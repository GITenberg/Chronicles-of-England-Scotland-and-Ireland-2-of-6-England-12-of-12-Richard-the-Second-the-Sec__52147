<p>The Londoners sent to K. Richard, commending themselues

<p class="pfirst padtopa">RICHARD, the second of that name, and sonne
to prince Edward, called the blacke prince, the sonne of king Edward
the third, a child of the age of eleuen yeares, began to reign ouer
the realme of England the two and twentith daie of Iune, in the yeare
of the world 5344, of our Lord 1377, after the conquest 310, about
the two and thirtith yeare of the emperour Charles the fourth, and in
the fouretéenth yeare of Charles the fift king of France, and about
the seuenth yeare of the reigne of Robert the <span class="xxpn" id="p712">|712|</span> second king of
Scotland: he was named Richard of Burdeaux, bicause he was borne at
Burdeaux in Gascoigne, whilest his father ruled there. The day before
it was vnderstood, that his grandfather king Edward was departed this
life, being the one and twentith of Iune (on which daie neuerthelesse
he deceassed) the citizens of London hauing certeine knowledge that he
could not escape his sicknesse, sent certeine aldermen vnto Kingston,
where the prince with his mother the princesse then laie, to declare
vnto the said prince their readie good wils, to accept him for their
lawfull king and gouernour, immediatlie after it should please God to
call to his mercie his grandfather, being now past hope of recouerie of
health. Wherefore they besought him, to haue their citie recommended
vnto his good grace, and that it would please him to visit the same
with his presence, sith they were readie in all sorts to honour and
obeie him, and to spend both liues and goods in his cause, if need
required.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Iohn Philpot.</p>

<p>The duke of Lancaster &amp; the Lōdoners submit their quarels
to the kings order.</p></div>

<p>Moreouer, they besought him, that it might please his grace to make an end of the
discord betwixt the citizens, and the duke of Lancaster, which through the malice of
some had béene raised, to the commoditie of none, but to the discommoditie of diuerse.
When Iohn Philpot, one of the foresaid aldermen, that had the words in all their names,
had ended his oration, he was answered by the prince and his councell, that he would
indeuour himselfe in all things to satisfie their requests, and so were they sent home to
bring a ioifull answer of their messege to the citie. The morrow after, there were sent
to London from the king, the lord Latimer, sir Nicholas Bond, sir Simon Burlie, &amp; sir
Richard Adderburie, knights; to bring them sorowfull newes of the assured death of
king Edward, who (as we haue said) deceassed the day before; but comfortable newes
againe, of the great towardlinesse and good meaning of the yoong king, who promised to
loue them and their citie, and to come to the same citie, as they had desired him to doo.
And further, that he had spoken to the duke of Lancaster in their behalfe, and that the
duke had submitted himselfe to him in all things touching the cause; wherevpon the kings
pleasure was, that they should likewise submit themselues, and he would doo his indeuor,
that an agreement might be had to the honor of the citizens, and profit of the
citie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The citizens liked not of this forme of procéeding in the dukes matter, bicause the
king was yoong, and could not giue order therein, but by substitutes: yet at length with
much adoo, they were contented to submit themselues, as the duke had doone before,
though not, till that the knights had vndertaken vpon their oth of fidelitie and knighthood,
that their submission should not redound to the temporall or bodilie harme of any of
them, consenting to the kings will in this point. And so with this caution they tooke
their iournie towards Sheene, where they found the new K. with his mother, the duke of
Lancaster &amp; his brethren, vncles to the king, and diuerse bishops, about the bodie of
the deceassed king. When it was knowen that the Londoners were come, they were
called before the king, by whom the matter was so handled, that the duke and they were
made fréends. After this, when the king should ride through the citie towards the coronation,
the said duke and the lord Percie riding on great horses before him, as by vertue
of their offices appointed to make way before, vsed themselues so courteouslie, modestlie,
and pleasantlie, that where before they two were greatlie suspected of the common people,
by reason of their great puissance in the realme, and huge rout of reteiners, they ordered
the matter so, that neither this day, nor the morrow after, being the day of the kings coronation,
they offended any maner of person, but rather by gentle and swéet demeanour
they reclaimed the harts of manie, of whome before they were greatlie had in suspicion,
and thought euill of.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ But</span> now, sith we are entred into the matter of this kings coronation,
we haue thought good breefelie to touch some particular point thereof (as in
Thomas Walsingham we find it) though nothing so largelie here, as the author himselfe
setteth it foorth, bicause the purpose of this worke will not so permit. <span class="xxpn" id="p713">|713|</span></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The maner &amp; order of the kings coronation.</p></div>

<p>The king, in riding thorough the citie towards Westminster, on the 15
daie of Iulie being wednesdaie, was accompanied with such a traine of
the nobilitie and others, as in such case was requisite. Sir Simon
Burlie bare the sword before him, and sir Nicholas Bond lead the
kings horsse by the bridle on foot. The noise of trumpets and other
instruments was maruellous, so that this seemed a day of ioy and mirth,
a day that had béene long looked for, bicause it was hoped, that
now the quiet orders and good lawes of the land, which thorough the
slouthfulnesse of the aged king deceassed, and couetousnesse of those
that ruled about him, had béene long banished, should now be renewed
and brought againe in vse. The citie was adorned in all sorts most
richlie. The water conduits ran with wine for the space of thrée houres
togither. In the vpper end of Cheape, was a certeine castell made with
foure towers, out of the which castell, on two sides of it, there ran
foorth wine abundantlie. In the towers were placed foure beautifull
virgins, of stature and age like to the king, apparelled in white
vestures, in euerie tower one, the which blew in the kings face, at his
approching néere to them, leaues of gold; and as he approched also,
they threw on him and his horsse florens of gold counterfeit.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>When he was come before the castell, they tooke cups of gold, and filling them with
wine at the spouts of the castell, presented the same to the king and to his nobles. On
the top of the castell, betwixt the foure towers, stood a golden angell, holding a crowne
in his hands, which was so contriued, that when the king came, he bowed downe &amp; offered
to him the crowne. But to speake of all the pageants and shewes which the citizens had
caused to be made, and set foorth in honour of their new king, it were superfluous;
euerie one in their quarters striuing to surmount other, and so with great triumphing of
citizens, and ioy of the lords and noble men, he was conueied vnto his palace at Westminster,
where he rested for that night. The morrow after being thursdaie, and the 16
day of Iulie, he was fetcht to the church with procession of the bishops and monks, and
comming before the high altar, where the pauement was couered with rich clothes of
tapistrie, he there kneeled downe and made his praiers, whilest two bishops soong the
Letanie, which being finished, the king was brought to his seat, the quéere singing an
antheme, beginning, Fermetur manus tua.</p>

<p>That doone, there was a sermon preached by a bishop touching the dutie of a king,
how he ought to behaue himselfe towards the people, and how the people ought to be
obedient vnto him. The sermon being ended, the king receiued his oth before the archbishop
and nobles: which doone, the archbishop hauing the lord Henrie Percie lord
marshall going before him, turned him to euerie quarter of the church, declaring to the
people the kings oth, and demanding of them, if they would submit themselues vnto such
a prince &amp; gouernor, and obeie his commandements: and when the people with a lowd
voice had answered that they would obeie him, the archbishop vsing certeine praiers,
blessed the king; which ended, the archbishop came vnto him, and tearing his garments
from the highest part to the lowest, stripped him to his shirt. Then was brought by
earles, a certeine couerture of cloth of gold, vnder the which he remained, whilest he
was annointed.</p>

<p>The archbishop (as we haue said), hauing stripped him, first annointed his hands,
then his head, brest, shoulders, and the ioints of his armes with the sacred oile, saieng
certeine praiers, and in the meane time did the quéere sing the antheme, beginning,
Vnxerunt regem Salomonem, &amp;c. And the archbishop added another praier, Deus
Dei filius, &amp;c. Which ended, he and the other bishops soong the hymne, Veni creator
spiritus, the king knéeling in a long vesture, &amp; the archbishop with his suffraganes
about him. When the hymne was ended, he was lift vp by the archbishop, and clad
first with the coate of saint Edward, and after with his mantell, a stoale being cast about
his necke, the archbishop in the meane time saieng certeine praiers appointed for
the purpose. After this, the archbishop and bishops deliuered to him the sword, saieng,
Accipe gladium, &amp;c. <span class="xxpn" id="p714">|714|</span></p>

<p>When that praier was ended, two earles girded him with the sword, which doone, the
archbishop gaue to him bracelets, saieng, Accipe armillas, &amp;c. After this, the archbishop
did put vpon him an vppermost vesture, called a pall, saieng, Accipe pallium, &amp;c. In
the meane time, whilest the archbishop blessed the kings crowne, he to whose office it
apperteined, did put spurs on his héeles. After the crowne was blessed, the archbishop set
it on his head, saieng, Coronet te Deus, &amp;c. Then did the archbishop deliuer to him a
ring, with these words, Accipe annulum, &amp;c. Immediatlie herewith came the lord Furniuall
by vertue of his office, offering to him a red gloue, which the archbishop blessed, and
putting it on his hand, gaue to him the scepter, with these words, Accipe sceptrum, &amp;c.
Then did the archbishop deliuer to him in his other hand a rod, in the top whereof stood a
doue, with these words, Accipe virgam virtutis, &amp;c. After this the archbishop blessed the
king, saieng, Benedicat de Deus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These things doone, the king kissed the bishops and abbats, by whome he was lead
afterwards vnto his seat, the bishops beginning to sing (Te Deum) which ended, the archbishop
said to him, Sta &amp; retine amodo locum, &amp;c. When these things were finished, they
began masse, the bishop of Worcester read the epistle, and the bishop of Elie the gospell.
At the offertorie, the king rose from his seat, and was brought to offer. He therfore offered
first his sword, and after so much gold as he would, but no lesse than a marke, by reason
of the custome; for more he might offer to God and S. Peter, but lesse he could not.
After this, he offered bread and wine, with which he and the archbishop did after communicate.
This doone, the earle, to whome it apperteined to beare the sword before the
king, redéemed the sword which the king had offered with monie, and receiuing the same,
bare it afore the king. When masse should be soong, the king was brought againe to the
altar, &amp; there knéeling downe, and saieng Confiteor to the archbishop, did communicate,
and so was brought backe to his seat. The wardens of the cinque ports by their office, as
well in time of the procession, as when he was annointed also at masse time, and as he
returned from the church to the palace to dinner, held ouer him a large canopie of blew
veluet, fastened vnto foure staues at the foure corners.</p>

<p>In the meane time, sir Iohn Dimmocke that claimed to be the kings champion, had
béen at the kings armorie and stable, where he had chosen according to his tenure, the best
armour saue one, and the best stéed saue one: albeit, sir Baldwine Freuill claimed the
same office, but could not obteine it; so that the said sir Iohn Dimmocke hauing armed
himselfe, and being mounted on horssebacke, came to the abbeie gates, with two riding
before him, the one carrieng his speare, and the other his shield, staieng there till masse
should be ended. But the lord Henrie Percie lord marshall, appointed to make waie
before the king with the duke of Lancaster lord Steward, the lord Thomas of Woodstoke
lord constable, and the lord marshals brother sir Thomas Percie, being all mounted on
great horsses, came to the knight, and told him, that he ought not to come at that time,
but when the king was at dinner, and therefore it should be good for him to vnarme himselfe
for a while, and take his ease and rest, till the appointed time were come.</p>

<p>The knight did as the lord marshall willed him, and so after his departure, the king
hauing those lords riding afore him, was borne on knights shoulders vnto his palace, and
so had to his chamber, where he rested a while, being somewhat faint with trauell, and
tooke a small refection. After this, comming into the hall, he created foure new earles,
before he sat downe to meat; to wit, his vncle the lord Thomas de Wodstoke earle of
Buckingham, to whome he gaue a thousand marks a yeare out of his treasurie, till he prouided
him of lands to the like value. The lord Guishard de Engolesme, that had béene
his tutor, was created earle of Huntington, to whome he gaue likewise a thousand marks
annuitie, till he were prouided of lands of like value. The lord Mowbraie was created
earle of Nottingham, and the lord Henrie Percie earle of North­um­ber­land. He made also
nine knights the same daie.</p>

<p>To shew what roiall seruice was at this feast, it passeth our vnderstanding to describe: <span class="xxpn" id="p715">|715|</span>
but to conclude, the fare was excéeding sumptuous, and the furniture princelie in all
things, that if the same should be rehearsed, the reader would perhaps doubt of the truth
therof.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ In</span> the midst of the kings palace was a marble pillar raised hollow vpon steps,
on the top whereof was a great gilt eagle placed, vnder whose feet in the chapiter of the
pillar, diuers kinds of wine came gushing foorth at foure seuerall places all the daie long,
neither was anie forbidden to receiue the same, were he neuer so poor or abiect. On the
morrow after the coronation, there was a generall procession of the archbishop, bishop,
and abbats then present, with the lords, and a great multitude of people, to praie for the
king and the peace of the kingdome.</p>

<p>At the going foorth of this procession, the bishop of Rochester preached, exhorting
them, that the dissentions and discords which had long continued betwixt the people and
their superiours, might be appeased and forgotten, proouing by manie arguments, that
the same highlie displeased God. He admonished the lords, not to be so extreme and
hard towards the people. On the other part, he exhorted the people in necessarie causes,
for the aid of the king and realme, chéerefullie, and without grudging, to put to their helping
hands, according to their bounden duties. He further exhorted those in generall that
were appointed to be about the king, that they should forsake vice, and studie to liue in
cleanesse of life and vertue. For if by their example the king were trained to goodnesse,
all should be well; but if he declined through their sufferance from the right waie, the
people and kingdome were like to fall in danger to perish. After the sermon and procession
were ended, the lords and prelats went to their lodgings.</p>

<p>But now, bicause the Englishmen should haue their ioies mingled with some sorrowes,
it chanced that the Frenchmen (which about the same time that the kings grandfather
departed this life, were wafting on the seas) within six or seauen daies after his deceasse,
burnt the towne of Rie. Wherevpon, immediatlie after the coronation, the earles of Cambridge
and Buckingham were sent with a power vnto Douer, and the earle of Salisburie
vnto Southampton: but in the meane time, to wit, the one and twentith of August, the
Frenchmen entring the Ile of Wight, burnt diuerse townes in the same.
And though they
were repelled from the castell, by the valiant manhood of sir Hugh Tirrell capteine
thereof, who laid no small number of them on the ground; yet they constreined the men
of the Ile to giue them a thousand marks of siluer to saue the residue of their houses and
goods, and so they departed from thence, sailing still along the costs, and where they saw
aduantage, set on land, burning sundrie towns néere to the shore, as Portesmouth, Dartmouth,
and Plimmouth.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Hastings burnt.</p>

<p>They made countenance also to haue set on Southampton, if sir Iohn Arundell, brother
to the earle of Arundell had not beene readie there with a number of men of armes and
archers, by whome the towne was defended, and the enimies chased to their ships. From
thence the Frenchmen departed, and sailing towards Douer, burnt Hastings; but Winchelsie
they could not win, being valiantlie defended by the abbat of Battell, and others.
After this, they landed one day not far from the abbeie of Lewes, at a place called Rottington,
where the prior of Lewes, and two knights, the one named sir Thomas Cheinie, and
the other sir Iohn Falleslie, hauing assembled a number of the countrie people, incountred
the Frenchmen, but were ouerthrowen; so that there were slaine about an hundred
Englishmen; and the prior, with the two knights, and an esquier called Iohn Brokas,
were taken prisoners, but yet the Frenchmen lost a great number of their owne men at this
conflict, and so with their prisoners retired to their ships and gallies, and after returned
into France.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But now touching the dooings about the new K. You shall vnderstand, that by reason
of his yoong yeares, as yet he was not able to gouerne himselfe, and therefore Iohn duke
of Lancaster, and Edmund earle of Cambridge,  with other péeres of the realme, were
appointed to haue the ad­min­is­tra­tion. He was of good disposition and towardnesse, but
his age being readie to incline which way soeuer a man should bend it, those that were <span class="xxpn" id="p716">|716|</span>
appointed to haue the gouernement of his person, did what laie in them now at the first,
to keepe him from all maner of light demeanor. But afterwards, when euerie one began to
studie more for his owne priuate commoditie, than for the aduancement of the commonwealth,
they set open the gates to other, which being readie to corrupt his good nature, by
little and little grew familiar with him, and dimming the brightnesse of true honour, with
the counterfeit shine of the contrarie, so maskered his vnderstanding, that in the end they
brought him to tract the steps of lewd demeanour, and so were causers both of his and
their owne destruction. This séemeth to be touched by C. Okland, who speaking of the
death of the old king and the erection of the new, saith of him according to our annales,

<p>Berwike castell recouered by the Englishmen.</p></div>

<p>The Frenchmen not ignorant of such mischéefes as were like to grow in England,
suffered no time to passe, but tooke occasions of aduantage when they were offered.&#160;
<span class="nowrap">¶ Among</span> other enterprises I find, that shortlie after the deceasse of king Edward, the
duke of Burgognie wan Arde, and two or three other fortresses in those marches. The
Scots this yeare also wan the castell of Berwike by stealth one morning, but shortlie vpon
knowledge had, the earles of North­um­ber­land and Notingham, the lords Neuill, Lucie,
Graistoke, &amp; Stafford, with other lords, knights, and esquiers, came with their powers in all
hast thither, and entring the towne, besieged the castell, and finallie, assaulting them that
kept it, wan it of them by force, and slue all those Scotishmen which they found within it,
except Alexander Ramsie their capteine. When the Englishmen had thus recouered the
castell, they entred into Scotland, in hope to find the Scots, and to fight with them whom
they knew to be assembled.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>An ouerthrow giuen by the Scots to the Englishmen.</p>

<p>The siege of Mortaigne raised.</p></div>

<p>The English host was thrée thousand men of armes, &amp; seuen thousand archers, but they
sent foorth sir Thomas Musgraue with thrée hundred speares, and thrée hundred archers,
to Meuros, to trie if he might vnderstand any thing of the Scots in those parts, with whom
the earle Dowglas, hauing with him seuen hundred speares, and two thousand of other
called yomen with glaiues and other weapons, incountered by chance and distressed him
&amp; his companie. Sir Thomas Musgraue himselfe, and six score other, were taken prisoners,
besides those that were slaine, the residue escaped by flight, making the best shift
they could for themselues. The lord Neuill, sir Thomas Triuet, sir William Scrope, and
diuerse other valiant capteins of England, were sent into Gascoigne this yeare, which first
landed at Burdeaux, on the euen of the Natiuitie of our ladie, where after they had rested
them a while, they went and raised the siege, which the Frenchmen had held before Mortaigne
in Poictou a long time before.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Gouernour of this siege at the first, was Yuan or Owen of Wales, but he was murthered
one morning as he sat alone viewing the castell, and combing his head, by one of his owne
countriemen, which vnder colour to serue him, was become with him verie familiar. This
Owen or Yuan whether ye will (for all is one) was sonne to a noble man of Wales, whom
K. Edward had put to death for some offense by him committed, where this Yuan got him
into France, being as then verie yoong, and was brought vp in the French court, and
prooued an expert man of warre, so that great lamentation was made for his death by the
Frenchmen. But the Englishmen, although they misliked the maner of his death, yet
they were not greatlie sorrowfull for the chance, sith they were rid thereby of an extreame
enimie.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">

<p>After that the Englishmen had raised the Frenchmen from the siege of Mortaigne, they
returned to Burdeaux, and after recouered sundrie castels and fortresses in the marches of <span class="xxpn" id="p717">|717|</span>
Burdelois, and about Baionne. Also they aided the king of Nauarre, against the king
of Castile, and made a road into the confines of Castile. But shortlie after, a peace was
concluded betwixt those two kings, so that the lord Charles of Nauarre should marrie
the daughter of the king of Castile vpon certeine conditions: and so the Englishmen had
their wages trulie paid them to their full contentation, and therevpon returned. About
Michaelmasse began a parlement that was summoned at Westminster, which continued
till the feast of saint Andrew. In this parlement the foresaid sir Peter de la Mere and
other the knights that had beene so earnest against dame Alice Peres in the last parlement
holden by king Edward the third, so prosecuted the same cause now in this parlement,
that the said dame Alice Peres was banished the realme, and all hir goods mooueable and
vnmooueable forfeited to the king, bicause contrarie to that she had promised by oth in
the said last parlement, she had presumed to come within the court, and to obteine of

<p class="pcontinue">But of Wickliffes life and doctrine to read at large, I remit the reader to the acts and

merchants of Bullongne were come to make their markets, but the sellers had quicke vtterance,
for that that might easilie be caried awaie, the Englishmen laid hands on, and caused

<p>Yée haue heard, how at the first the duke of Lancaster was one of the chéefe about
the yoong king in gouernement of his person and realme, who prudentlie considering,
that sith there must néeds be an alteration in the state, &amp; doubting least if any thing
chanced otherwise than well, the fault and blame might be chéefelie imputed to him, and
thanks (howsoeuer things went) he looked for none, he gaue therefore the slip, obteining
licence of the king to depart, and so got him home to his castell of Killingworth, permitting
other to haue the whole swaie: for before his departure from the court, there
were with his consent ordeined such as should be attending on the kings person, and
haue the rule and ordering of matters perteining to the state, as William Courtnie, then
bishop of London (though shortlie after remooued to the archbishops see of Canturburie)
Edmund Mortimer earle of March, &amp; diuerse other, of whome the people had conceiued
a good opinion: but yet bicause the bishop of Salisburie, and the lord Latimer
were admitted amongst the residue, the commons murmured greatlie against them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The earle of North­um­ber­land resigned his office of lord marshall, in whose place succeeded
sir Iohn Arundell, brother vnto the earle of Arundell.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ The</span> duke of Lancaster,
although retired from the court, yet desirous to haue the monie in his hands that was
granted the last parlement, at length obteined it, vpon promise to defend the realme
from inuasion of all enimies for one yeares space: he therefore prouided a great nauie
to go to the sea, hiring nine ships of Baionne, to assist his enterprise herein, the which
in making saile hitherwards, incountred with the Spanish fléet, and tooke fouretéene vessels
laden with wines and other merchandize. But in the meane time, one Mercer a
Scotishman, with certeine saile of Scots, Frenchmen, and Spaniards, came to Scarburgh,
and there tooke certeine ships, and led them awaie to the sea, as it were in reuenge of his
fathers imprisonment, named Iohn Mercer, who before being caught by certeine ships

stronglie furnished with men of warre and munition necessarie: the men of warre méeting

they tooke the said Mercer with all them that were then in his companie, so recouering
againe the ships that were taken from Scarburgh, besides great riches which were found
aboord, as well in the fiftéene Spanish ships, as the other that were of the old retinue,
belonging to the same Mercer. Iohn Philpot was afterwards blamed of the lords, for
presuming thus far, as to set foorth a nauie of men of warre, without the aduise of the

<p>Before all such prouision as the duke of Lancaster prepared for his iournie to the sea
could be readie, the earles of Salisburie and Arundell sailed ouer into Normandie, where,
by such composition as was taken betwixt the king of England and the king of Nauarre,
who of new was become enimie to the French king, the towne of Chierburg was deliuered
vnto the said earles, who sending knowledge thereof backe into England, there were sent
ouer such as should haue in charge the kéeping of that towne; and so the two earles returned.&#160;
<span class="nowrap">¶ We</span> find, that the king of Nauarre, hauing beene heere in England with the
king and his councell, had agréed with the king for a certeine yearelie rent, to demise
vnto him the said fortresse of Chierburg, whereby the Englishmen might haue frée entrie
into Normandie, when they would, as well to aid the king of Nauarre in his necessitie,

not so much ioy to the English nation, as the mishap that happened at the going foorth
of the said earles did cause lamentation and heauinesse.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The English nauie is ouermatched and ouercome by the Spanish fléet.</p></div>

<p>For vpon the first entring into the sea, it fortuned that sir Philip, and sir Peter Courtenie,
discouered a certeine number of ships that were enimies, and vndiscréetlie entered amongst
them, there suddenlie came vpon them the Spanish fléet, so that the English ships that were
in companie with the said Philip and sir Peter, were not able to make their partie good,
in somuch that finallie after that sir Philip had lost diuerse of his men that were there
slaine, he got awaie by flight himselfe, though gréeuouslie wounded, but sir Peter was taken
prisoner with a few other knights that were with him; and the most part of all the valiant

drowned, which was estéemed no small losse to the whole com­mon-wealth.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Thus were the Englishmen occupied in this first yeare of king Richard with troubles

in the beginning of the same yeare, the Scots burnt Rokesburgh, in reuenge whereof the
new earle of North­um­ber­land entered Scotland with ten thousand men, and sore spoiled
the lands of the earle of March for the space of thrée daies togither; bicause the said
earle of March was the chéefe author and procurer of the burning of Rokesburgh, &amp; so
for that time th’ Englishmen were well reuenged of those enimies. But at an other time,
when the Northerne men would néeds make a rode into Scotland, entring by the west
borders, they were incountered by the Scots and put to flight, so that manie of them being
slaine, the Scots tooke the more courage to inuade the borders, till at length, Edmund
Mortimer earle of March came at the daie of truce, and tooke an abstinence of warre
betwixt both nations for the time, though the same continued not long.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Anon after Midsummer, the duke of Lancaster with a strong power tooke the sea, and

There went ouer with him the earles of Buckingham, Warwike, Stafford, and
diuerse other of the English nobilitie, the which made their approches, and fiercelie
assailed the towne, but it was so valiantlie defended, that in the end, the duke with his <span class="xxpn" id="p720">|720|</span>
armie raised from thence, and returned without atchiuing his purpose.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ About</span> the

at Westminster, by occasion of variance betwéene the lord Latimer and sir Rafe Ferrers

Shakell on the other partie, about a prisoner which was taken at the battell of Nazers in
Spaine, called the earle of Deane, who (as some write) was taken by one sir Franke de
Hall at the said battell; and bicause he remained in his hands at the death of the said sir
Franke, he bequeathed him vnto his sonne the said Robert Hall
esquier.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p><i>Thom. Wals.</i></p></div>

<p>But as other write, the said earle was taken by the said Robert Hall himselfe &amp; Iohn
Shakell iointlie, and iudged to be their lawfull prisoner, by the sentence of the prince of
Wales, and sir Iohn Chandois that was master to the said esquiers. Wherevpon afterwards
the said earle obteined so much fauor, that by leauing his sonne and heire in gage
for his ransome, he returned into Spaine, to prouide monie to discharge it; but he was
so slow in that matter, after he was at libertie, that he departed this life before he made
any paiment, and so his lands fell to his sonne that remained in gage for the monie with
the two esquiers. Wherevpon it happened afterwards, that the duke of Lancaster, desirous
to haue the yoong earle in his hands (in hope through his meanes the better to accomplish
his enterprise which he meant to take in hand against the king of Castile, for the
right of that kingdome) procured his nephue king Richard to require the said earle of
Deane, at the hands of the said esquiers.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But they refused to deliuer him, keeping their prisoner foorth of the waie, so that none
wist were he was become: the esquiers therefore were committed to the tower, out of
the which they escaped vnto Westminster, and there registred themselues for sanctuarie
men. The duke of Lancaster was herewith sore offended, and their enimies the said lord
Latimer and sir Rafe Ferrers tooke counsell togither, with sir Alane Boxhull and others,
how they might be reuenged of this despite. This sir Alane Boxhull was constable of the
tower, and therefore it greeued him not a little, that the esquiers had broken from him
and kept themselues thus at Westminster, vnder protection of that priuileged place.
Herevpon it was concluded, that sir Rafe Ferrers, and the said Alane Boxhull, taking
with them certeine men in armour, to the number of fiftie persons, should go and fetch
them by force from Westminster, vnto the tower againe.</p>

<p>The morrow therefore after saint Laurence daie, being the eleuenth of August, these
two knights accompanied with certeine of the kings seruants and other, to the number
afore mentioned, came into the church at Westminster, whilest the said esquiers were
there hearing of high masse, which was then in celebrating; and first laieng hands vpon
Iohn Shakell, vsed the matter so with him, that they drew him foorth of the church, and
led him streight to the tower. But when they came to Robert Hall, and fell in reasoning
with him, he would not suffer them to come within his reach, and perceiuing they
meant to take him by force, he drew out a falcheon or short sword which he had girt to
him, and therewith laid so fréelie about him, trauersing twise round about the moonks
quier, that till they had beset him on ech side, they could doo him no hurt.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A cruell murther in Westminster church.</p></div>

<p>Howbeit, at length when they had got him at that aduantage, one of them cloue his
head to the verie braines, and an other thrust him through the bodie behind with a sword,
and so they murthered him among them. They slue also one of the moonkes that would
haue had them to haue saued the esquiers life. Much adoo was about this matter, for
the breaking thus of the sanctuarie, in somuch that the archbishop of Canturburie, and
fiue other bishops his suffragans, openlie pronounced all them that were present at this
murder accurssed, and likewise all such as aided or counselled them to it, cheeflie and
namelie sir Alane Boxhull, and sir Rafe Ferrers, capteins and leaders of them. The
king, the queene, and the duke of Lancaster were yet excepted by speciall names. The
bishop of London a long time after, euerie sundaie, wednesdaie, and fridaie, pronounced
this ex­com­mun­i­ca­tion in the church of S. Paule at London. <span class="xxpn" id="p721">|721|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The duke of Lancaster (though excepted in the same) yet in behalfe of his fréends was
not a little offended with the bishops dooings, in so much that in a councell holden at
Windsore (to the which the bishop of London was called, but would not come, nor
yet ceasse the pronouncing of the cursse, albeit the king had requested him by his letters)
the duke said openlie, that the bishops froward dealings were not to be borne with, but
(saith he) if the king would command me, I would gladlie go to London, and fetch that
disobedient prelat, in dispite of those ribaulds (for so he termed them) the Londoners.
These words procured the duke much euill will, as well of the Londoners, as of other: for
it was commonlie said, that whatsoeuer had béene doone at Westminster, concerning the
murther there committed in the church, was doone by his commandement.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A parlement at Glocester.</p></div>

<p>About the feast of S. Luke, a parlement was holden at Glocester, for the displeasure
(as was thought) which some of the councell had conceiued against the Londoners, or
rather (as some tooke it) for feare of them, least if any thing were doone contrarie to
their minds, they should be about to hinder it, if the parlement had beene kept neere
them: for manie things (as some iudged) were meant to haue beene put foorth and concluded
in this parlement, albeit few in effect came to passe of those matters that were
surmised, sauing that it was inacted, that the king should haue a marke of the merchants
for euerie sacke of their woolles, for this present yeare; and for euerie pounds worth of
wares that was brought in from beyond the seas, and here sold, six pence of the buiers.&#160;
<span class="nowrap">¶ Also,</span> certeine priuileges were granted in this parlement to mer­chant-stran­gers, that they

elected an other pope whome they named Clement, which cardinals sent likewise their
messengers with letters, to beséech the king to aid them with his fauourable assistance:
but through persuasion of the archbishop of Canturburie, Vrbans request was granted,

singular commendation; as likewise did sir Alane de Heton, and sir Thomas de Ilderton,

<p>And bicause this enterprise was taken in hand against the couenant of the truce, the
earle of North­um­ber­land, before he attempted to recouer the castell, sent to the earle of
March in Scotland, to vnderstand if he would auow that which his countrimen had doone,
touching the winning of that castell, who sent him knowledge againe, that he neither

pleased the earle of North­um­ber­land, he would come himselfe, and helpe to recouer it to
the K. of Englands vse, out or those Scotishmens hands, which without publike authoritie
had made that exploit. This yeare, sir Robert Rous, capteine of Chierburg, was called <span class="xxpn" id="p722">|722|</span>

<p>In a parlement holden at Westminster this yeare after Easter, it was ordeined, that the
priuileges and immunities of the abbeie of Westminster should remaine whole and inuiolate;
but yet there was a prouiso against those that tooke sanctuarie, with purpose to
defraud their creditors, that their lands &amp; goods shuld be answerable to the discharging
of their debts. In the same parlement was granted to the king a subsidie, to be leuied
of the great men of the land. To the end the commons might be spared, the dukes of
Lancaster and Britaine paied twentie marks, euerie earle six marks, bishops and abbats
with miters as much, and euerie moonke thrée shillings foure pence: also, euerie iustice,
shiriffe, knight, esquier, parson, vicar, and chapleine, were charged after a certeine rate,
but not any of the commons that were of the
laitie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Ye haue heard how sir Iohn Harleston was sent to Chierburg as capteine of that fortresse,
who issuing abroad on a day, with such power as he might take foorth, leauing
the fortresse furnished, came to a place, where within a church and in a mill, the Frenchmen
had laid vp, as in storehouses, a great quantitie of vittels, for prouision; which
church and mill the Englishmen assaulted so valiantlie, that not­with­stand­ing there were
within a good number of the enimies, that did their best to defend themselues, yet at
length they were taken, and sir Iohn Harleston with his companie, returned with the vittels
towards Chierburg, but by the way they were incountred by one sir William de
Bourds, whome the French king had appointed to lie in Mountburg with a strong power
of men of war, to countergarison Chierburg.</p>

<p>Herevpon insued a sore conflict, and manie an hardie man was beaten to the ground.
And although it séemed that the Englishmen were ouermatched in number, yet they
stucke to it manfullie. Their capteine sir Iohn Harleston, fighting in the foremost
presse, was felled, and laie on the ground at his enimies féet in great hazard of death.
The Englishmen neuerthelesse continued their fight, till at length sir Geffrie Worslie,
with a wing of armed footmen with axes, came to the rescue (for to that end he was left <span class="xxpn" id="p723">|723|</span>
behind, of purpose to come to their aid if néed required) with whose comming the
Frenchmen were so hardlie handled, that to conclude, they were broken insunder, beaten
downe and wholie vanquished: there were of them slaine aboue six score, and as manie
taken prisoners, among which number was their chéefe capteine sir William de Bourdes
taken, and brought to Chierburg with the residue, and there put in safe keeping. This
exploit was atchiued by the Englishmen, on saint Martins day in winter, in this third
yeare of king Richard his reigne.</p>

<p>Sir Iohn Clearke a valiant capteine.</p>

<p>But least any ioy should come to the English people in that season, without some mixture
of gréefe, one sir I. Clearke a right valiant knight, &amp; fellow in armes with sir Hugh
Caluerlie, chanced this yeare to lie in garrison in a castell in Britaine, where was an
hauen, &amp; diuerse English ships lieng in the same, whereof the French gallies being
aduertised, came thither, to set those ships on fire, appointing one of their gallies first to
attempt the feat, and if fortune so would, to traine the Englishmen foorth, till they should
fall into the laps of foure other gallies which they laid as it had béene in ambush. Now
as the enimies wished so it came to passe, for the Englishmen perceiuing their vessels in
danger to be burnt of the enimies, ran euerie man aboord to sane the ships and goods
within them; and amongst the rest, sir Iohn Clearke their capteine, meaning to take such
part as his men did, got aboord also, and streight falling in pursute of the gallie that withdrew
for the purpose aforesaid, the Englishmen were shortlie inclosed with the other
gallies before they were aware, not knowing what shift to make to auoid the present
danger.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Sir Iohn Clearke, perceiuing how the case stood, laid about him like a giant, causing
his companie still to draw backe againe, whilest he resisting the enimies, did shew such
proofe of his valiancie, that they were much astonished therewith. To be short, he so
manfullie behaued himselfe, that the most part of his companie had time to recouer land;
but when he that had thus preserued others shuld leape foorth of the ship to saue himselfe,
he was striken on the thigh with an ax, that downe he fell, and so came into the
enimies hands, being not able to recouer that hurt, for his thigh was almost quite cut off
from the bodie, so that he died of that and other hurts presentlie, leauing a remembrance
behind him of manie worthie acts through his valiancie atchiued, to his high praise and
great commendation. The barke of Yorke was also lost the same time, being a proper
vessell; and now taken suddenlie, sanke with all that were aboord in hir, both Englishmen,
and the enimies also that were entered into hir, thinking to carrie hir awaie.</p>

<p>About the same time the duke of Britaine returning into his countrie, vnder the conduct

Malo, the fourth day of August, being receiued with vnspeakable ioy of the Britaines, as
well lords as commons, so that the louing harts which they bare towards him, might
well appeare, although the loue which he bare to the king of England had caused his
subiects, in fauor of France, to kéepe him manie yeares foorth of his dukedome as a
banished prince, but at length, they being ouercome with irkesomnesse of his long absence,
with generall consents sent for him home, so that there were but few of the British nobilitie
that withdrew their dutifull obedience from him, and those were onelie such as
firmelie linked in seruice with the French king, were loth to forgo such roomes and

<p>The lord de la Vall amongst other, came to him (as we find in Thomas Walsingham)
offering him his seruice as well as the residue. At his landing, he was likelie to haue
lost all such furniture, as well of vittels, apparell, hangings, bedding, armour, and
other things, which either he or his traine had brought with them. For the French gallies
espieng their time, immediatlie as he and his companie were set on land, before the ships
in which the said furniture was fraught, could enter the hauen, which was somewhat <span class="xxpn" id="p724">|724|</span>
streight and narrow, came vpon them, and had them at such aduantage, that if sir Hugh
Caluerlie with his archers had not caused the master of his ship, euen against his will to
returne againe to the rescue, the gallies had taken and gone awaie with the other ships;
but through the manfull prowes of sir Hugh, the gallies were repelled, &amp; the ships saued:
for according to his woonted valiancie he would not returne, till he saw all other in safetie,
&amp; then defending himselfe so well as he might, withdrew into the hauen, and landed safelie
with the residue.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>An hainous murther of a merchant stranger.</p>

<p>Great death in the north countrie.</p>

<p>Great spoile by the Scots in the death time.</p></div>

<p>About the same time was an hainous murther committed in London, of a merchant
Genowes, whome certeine English merchants vpon spite and enuie, which they bare towards
him, caused to be slaine one euening in the stréet before his own gates. The
cause that mooued the merchants so to procure his death was, for that he vndertooke to
furnish this land, hauing the staple allowed him at Southhampton, of all such wares as
came foorth of Leuant, so plentifullie as was to be had in any place in all the west parts
of christendome. In the summer of this yeare, a greeuous mortalitie afflicted the north
parts of this land, so that the countrie became almost desolate. And to the increase of
that miserie, the Scots thinking the time to serue their turne, inuaded the borders, and
most cruellie harried, robbed, and spoiled the same, not letting passe any part, of most
cruell murthering of the people that were left aliue, and not made awaie by that sore contagious
sicknesse. The number of cattell was infinite which they droue out of the land
with them, not sparing heards of swine which they tooke at this time, where they neuer
medled with that kind of cattell before that present.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Before the Scots made this iournie into England, whilest the mortalitie was most in
force, they calling to certeine of the English borderers, asked of them how it came to
passe, that so great a death reigned amongst them. The Englishmen, as good, plaine,
and simple meaning men, told them, that trulie they knew not the cause, for Gods iudgements
were hid from them in such behalfe. But one thing they knew, that all calamitie,
death, and aduersitie that chanced vnto them, came by the speciall grace of God, to the
end that being punished for their sinnes, they might learne to repent and amend their
wicked liues. The Scots hearing this, when they should enter this land, vnderstanding
lewdlie what the Englishmen had told them concerning the disease, and the grace of
God, deuised a blessing forsooth to be said euerie morning, of the most ancient person
in euerie familie, as; Benedicite, said he: Dominus, said the residue. Then began he
againe, saieng; God and saint Mango, saint Romane and saint Andro, shield vs this
daie fra Gods grace, and the fewle death that Englishmen dien vpon. Thus the senselesse
men misconstruing this word the grace of God, praied for their owne destruction,
which if not in this world, yet for their brutish crueltie vsed at that present, against the
miserable creatures, whom the hand of God had spared in time of that gréeuous mortalitie,
it is to be feared, least in another world it came to them, as the verie words of their
praiers imported.</p>

<p>About the same time, Iohn Schakell esquier was set at libertie, the king compounded
with him for his prisoner, giuing fiue hundred marks in redie monie, and lands to the
value of a hundred marks by yeare. When he should bring foorth his prisoner, and deliuer
him to the king, this is to be noted, as a thing verie strange and woonderfull. For
when he should appeare, it was knowne to be the verie groome that had serued him in all
the time of his trouble, and would neuer vtter himselfe what he was before that time,
hauing serued him as an hired seruant all that while in prison, and out of prison, in
danger of life, when his other maister was murthered, where, if he would haue vttered
himselfe, he might haue beene enterteined in such honorable state, as for a prisoner of
his degrée had beene requisit, so that the faithfull loue and assured constancie in this

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The English nauie scattered by a terrible tempest.</p></div>

<p>About the feast of S. Nicholas, in this third yeare of king Richards reigne, there went <span class="xxpn" id="p725">|725|</span>
to sea an armie of men, that should haue passed ouer into Britaine, to the aid of the duke
there, vnder the conduct of sir Iohn Arundell, sir Hugh Caluerlie, sir Thomas Percie,
sir William Elmham, sir Thomas Morews, sir Thomas Banester, &amp; manie other knights
and esquires, too long to rehearse, a sufficient power vndoubtedlie to haue doone a great
enterprise: but they were no sooner on the sea, but suddenlie there arose such an hideous
tempest of wind and stormes, that they looked presentlie to be all cast awaie, they were
scattered here and there, and driuen they wist not whither. The ship wherein sir Iohn
Arundell was aboord, chanced to be cast on the coast of Ireland, and there driuen to forsake
his ship, that was readie to be broken in péeces by rage of waues, beating it there
against the rocks: he was drowned before he could win to land, in an Ile, neere to the
which they had thrust in the ship.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>To the like end came sir Thomas Banester, sir Nicholas Trumpington, and sir Thomas
Dale, impeaching each others, as they leapt foorth of the ship: also one Musard an
esquire, a most séemelie personage and a bold; and an other esquier named Denioke,
being almost out of danger, were fetched awaie by the surges of the sea, and so perished,
with manie other. Robert Rust a cunning seaman, belonging to Blacknie in Northfolke,
&amp; maister of the ship wherein sir Iohn Arundell was imbarked, was the first that got to
land, giuing example to others how to shift for themselues. But when he saw his cheefe
capteine, the said sir Iohn Arundell got foorth to the sands, and as one thinking himselfe
past all danger, to shake his wet garments about him; the said Rust waieng the dangerous
state wherein the said sir Iohn Arundell yet stood, came downe, and raught to him his
hand, inforsing himselfe to plucke him to the shore: but whilest he tooke care for an other
mans safetie, and neglected his owne, he lost his life, and so they both perished togither;
for through a mightie billow of the raging seas, they were both ouerthrowne, and with returning
of the waues backe, drawne into the deepe, so that they could neuer recouer
foot-hold againe, but were drowned.</p>

<p>The said Rust was much lamented, bicause he was not onelie knowne to be a skilfull
maister, but also counselled the said sir Iohn Arundell in no wise to go to sea, at what
time he would needs set forward, forsing the said Rust and the marriners to hoist vp sailes
and make awaie. They that scaped to land in that Ile, found nothing there to releeue
their miseries, but bare ground, so that diuerse starved through cold, wanting fier and
other succour: the residue that were lustie and wise withall, ran vp and downe, and
sometime wrestling, and otherwise chafing themselues, remained there in great miserie,
from the thursdaie till sundaie at noone next insuing. At what time, when the sea was
appeased and waxen calme, the Irishmen that dwelled ouer against this Ile on the maine,
came and fetched them thence, and reléeued them the best they could, being almost dead,
through trauell, hunger, and cold.</p>

<p>Outragious wickednesse iustlie punished.</p></div>

<p>The said sir Iohn Arundell lost not onelie his life, but all his furniture and apparell
for his bodie, which was verie sumptuous, so that it was thought to surmount the apparell
of any king. For he had two and fiftie new sutes of apparell of cloth of gold or
tissue, as was reported, all the which, togither with his horsses &amp; geldings, amounting
to the value of ten thousand marks, was lost at the sea. And besides this, there were
lost at the same time fiue and twentie ships, with men, horsses, and other riches, which
attended him in that voiage. Yet sir Thomas Percie, and sir Hugh Caluerlie, with sir
William Elmham, and certeine others escaped, but cruellie tormented with vnmercifull
tempest: and before sir Thomas Percie could get to land, after the sea was quieted, he
was assaulted by a Spaniard, against whome he so defended himselfe, that in the end he
tooke the Spanish vessell, and brought hir, with all that he found aboord in hir, vnto
the next shore, and sold the same for an hundred pounds, and without long delaie, tooke
the sea, &amp; passed ouer to Brest, of which fortresse he was capteine, iointlie with sir
Hugh Caluerlie, and therefore doubting least some inconuenience might chance thereto
now in both their absence, he made the more hast, not taking rest till he came thither, <span class="xxpn" id="p726">|726|</span>
not­with­stand­ing his passed painefull trauels. Sir Hugh Caluerlie was neuer in his life
in more danger of death, than at that time: for all that were in his ship (as Froissard
writeth) were drowned, except himselfe &amp; seauen mariners. We find, that there were
drowned in one place &amp; other, aboue a thousand Englishmen in that most vnluckie
voiage.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ Some</span> writers impute this calamitie to light on the said sir Iohn Arundell &amp;
his companie, for the lasciuious and filthie rule which they kept before their setting
foorth, in places where they laie, till their prouision was readie; who not content with
that which they did before they tooke ship, in rauishing men wiues, maids and daughters,
they carried them aboord, that they might haue the vse of them whilest they were vpon

<p class="pcontinue">and
yet when the tempest rose, like cruell and vnmercifull persons they threw them into
the sea, either for that they would not be troubled with their lamentable noise and
crieng, or for that they thought so long as they had such women aboord with them
(whome they had abused so long) God would not cease the rage of the tempest. But it
should appeare that this tempest was generall, for where the Spanish and French fléets
were abroad at the same time, being assembled togither to annoie the coasts of this land,
their ships were likewise tossed and turmoiled, so as no small number of them were lost,
in so much that the damage which they susteined, was thought far to passe that which
hapned to the English nauie.</p>

of Constantine in Normandie, belonging some time to sir Iohn Chandois, had béene
committed to the said Katrington, as capteine thereof, to keepe it against the enemies,
he had for monie sold and deliuered it ouer to the Frenchmen, where he was sufficientlie

constable and marshall of the realme, and that the combat was accepted by the
parties. Herevpon was the day and place appointed, and all things prouided readie,
with lists railed and made so substantiallie, as if the same should haue indured for euer.
The concourse of people that came to London to sée this tried, was thought to excéed
that of the kings coronation, so desirous men were to behold a sight so strange and vnaccustomed.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The order of the combat.</p>

<p>The earle of Buckingham claimeth the horsse.</p></div>

<p>The king, his nobles, and all the people being come togither in the morning of the
daie appointed, to the place where the lists were set vp, the knight being armed and
mounted on a faire courser seemelie trapped, entered first as appellant, staieng till his
aduersarie the defendant should come. And shortlie after was the esquier called to defend
his cause in this forme: Thomas Katrington defendant, come and appeare to saue
the action, for which sir Iohn Anneslie knight and appellant hath publikelie and by
writing appealed thée. He being thus called thrise by an herald at armes, at the third
call did come armed likewise; and riding on a courser trapped with traps imbrodered
with his armes, at his approching to the lists he alighted from his horsse, lest according
to the law of armes the constable should haue challenged the horsse if he had entered
within the lists. But his shifting nothing auailed him, for the horsse after his maister
was alighted beside him, ran vp &amp; downe by the railes, now thrusting his head ouer, and
now both head &amp; breast, so that the earle of Buckingham, bicause he was high constable
of England, claimed the horsse afterwards, swearing that he would haue so much
of him as had appeared ouer the railes, and so the horsse was adiudged vnto him.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But now to the matter of the combat (for this challenge of the horsse was made after,
as soone as the esquier was come within the lists) the indenture was brought foorth by
the marshall and constable, which had béene made and sealed before them, with consent
of the parties, in which were conteined the articles exhibited by the knight against the
esquier, and there the same was read before all the assemblie. The esquier (whose
conscience was thought not to be cleare, but rather guiltie, and therefore seemed full of
troublesome and grudging passions, as an offendor alreadie conuinced, thought (as full
well he might)</p>

<div><div class="pstanza">
<p class="pverse">Multa miser timeo, quia feci multa proteruè)</p>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">went about to make exceptions, that his cause by some means might haue séemed the
sounder. But the duke of Lancaster hearing him so staie at the matter, sware, that <span class="xxpn" id="p728">|728|</span>
except according to the conditions of the combat, and the law of armes, he would admit
all things in the indentures comprised, that were not made without his owne consent, he
should as guiltie of the treason foorthwith be had foorth to execution. The duke with
those words woone great commendation, and auoided no small suspicion that had béene
conceiued of him as parciall in the esquiers cause. The esquier hearing this, said, that he
durst fight with the knight, not onelie in those points, but in all other in the world whatsoeuer
the same might be: for he trusted more to his strength of bodie, and fauour of his
freends, than to the cause which he had taken vpon him to defend. He was in déed a
mightie man of stature, where the knight among those that were of a meane stature was one
of the least. Freends to the esquier, in whom he had great affiance to be borne out
through their assistance, were the lords Latimer and Basset, with others.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The esquire is ouerthrowne.</p></div>

<p>Before they entered battell, they tooke an oth, as well the knight as the esquier, that
the cause in which they were to fight, was true, and that they delt with no witchcraft, nor
art magike, whereby they might obteine the victorie of their aduersarie, nor had about them
any herbe or stone, or other kind of experiment with which magicians vse to triumph ouer
their enimies. This oth receiued of either of them, and therewith hauing made their
praiers deuoutlie, they began the battell, first with speares, after with swords, and lastlie
with daggers. They fought long, till finallie the knight had bereft the esquier of all his
weapons, and at length the esquier was manfullie ouerthrowne by the knight. But as the
knight would haue fallen vpon the esquier, through sweat that ran downe by his helmet
his sight was hindered, so that thinking to fall vpon the esquier, he fell downe sideling
himselfe, not comming néere to the esquier, who perceiuing what had happened, although
he was almost ouercome with long fighting, made to the knight, and threw himselfe vpon
him, so that manie thought the knight should haue beene ouercome: other doubted
not but that the knight would recouer his feet againe, and get the victorie of his aduersarie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The king in the meane time caused it to be proclamed that they should staie, and that
the knight should be raised vp from the ground, and so meant to take vp the matter betwixt
them. To be short, such were sent as should take vp the esquier; but comming to the
knight, he besought them, that it might please the king to permit them to lie still, for he
thanked God he was well, and mistrusted not to obteine the victorie, if the esquier might
be laid vpon him, in manner as he was earst. Finallie, when it would not be so granted,
he was contented to be raised vp, and was no sooner set on his féet, but he cheerfullie went
to the king, without anie mans helpe, where the esquier could neither stand nor go without
the helpe of two men to hold him vp, and therefore was set in his chaire to take his ease, to
see if he might recouer his strength.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The esquier fainteth.</p>

<p>The knight is iudged the vanquisher.</p></div>

<p>The knight at his comming before the king, besought him &amp; his nobles, to grant him so
much, that he might be eftsoones laid on the ground as before, and the esquier to be laid
aloft vpon him: for the knight perceiued that the esquire through excessiue heat, and the
weight of his armor, did maruellouslie faint, so as his spirits were in manner taken from
him. The king and the nobles perceiuing the knight so couragiouslie to demand to trie
the battell foorth to the vttermost, offring great summes of monie, that so it might be doone,
decreed that they should be restored againe to the same plight in which they laie when
they were raised vp: but in the meane time the esquire fainting, and falling downe in a
swoone, fell out of his chaire, as one that was like to yéeld vp his last breath presentlie
among them. Those that stood about him cast wine and water vpon him, séeking
so to bring him againe, but all would not serue, till they had plucked off his armor, &amp;
his whole apparell, which thing prooued the knight to be vanquisher, and the esquier to be
vanquished.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>After a little time the esquier began to come to himselfe, and lifting vp his eies, began
to hold vp his head, and to cast a ghostlie looke on euerie one about him: which when it
was reported to the knight, he commeth to him armed as he was (for he had put off no <span class="xxpn" id="p729">|729|</span>
péece since the beginning of the fight) and speaking to him, called him traitor, and false
periured man, asking of him if he durst trie the battell with him againe: but the esquier
hauing neither sense nor spirit whereby to make answer, proclamation was made that the
battell was ended, and euerie one might go to his lodging. The esquier immediatlie after
he was brought to his lodging, and laid in bed, began to wax raging wood, and so continuing
still out of his wits, about nine of the clocke the next day he yéelded vp the ghost.&#160;

<p><i>Froissard.</i> The earle of Buckingham sent into Britaine to aid the
duke against the French king.</p></div>

<p>About the same time or rather somewhat before, the lord Oliuer de Clisson, with a
number of ships and gallies of France and Spaine, tooke the sea, and comming on the
coast of England, landed in diuerse places of the west countrie, and also in the south parts,
and burning sundrie townes, taking such ships and vessels as they might laie hold
vpon, and so continued to indamage the English people that inhabited néere to the sea
side, all that summer following.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ In</span> the beginning of the fourth yeare of this king,
Thomas of Woodstoke earle of Buckingham, vncle to the king, with an armie of seauen or
eight thousand men of armes and archers, was sent ouer to Calis, that he might inuade
France, and passe through the same to come into Britaine vnto the aid of the duke there.&#160;
<span class="nowrap">¶ You</span> haue heard how the French king had seized into his hands the more part of the
duchie of Britaine, bicause that the duke had ioined himselfe in league with the king of
England: but yet there were diuerse of the good townes, and also manie of the barons and
nobles of the countrie which kept themselues as neuters a long season; but at length,
longing to see the returne of their naturall lord and duke, sent for him into England,
requiring him to repaire home, and to see to the quieting of the troubled state of his
countrie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The duke being thus earnestlie desired to returne home, by the aduise of the king of
England and his councell, granted to their request that had so instantlie required him,
both by letters and sufficient messengers: wherevpon he tooke the sea, and sailing foorth,
arriued in Britaine, hauing with him sir Robert Knolles, and a certeine number of Englishmen
both armed men and archers (as before yee haue heard.) The king also promised
to send him a new supplie verie shortlie, which was not forgotten. But fortune was so
contrarie, that sir Iohn Arundell generall of those that were sent, and manie of his companie,
were drowned by force of tempest, and the other driuen backe againe into England
(as before ye haue heard.) In the meane time, though the duke of Britaine with aid of
his subiects, did manfullie defend his townes and countrie against the Frenchmen, yet he
was in doubt to be oppressed by the great puissance of the Frenchmen, if aid came not the
sooner. Which being signified ouer into England, mooued the king and his councell to
appoint the earle of Buckingham to take vpon him this voiage. He landed at Calis three
daies before the feast of Marie Magdalene.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Knights made by the earle of Buckingham at his entrie into France.</p></div>

<p>There went ouer with him in that armie, the earls of Stafford and Deuonshire, the lord
Spenser constable of the host, the lord Fitz Walter marshall, the lord Basset, the lord
Bourchier, the lord Ferrers, the lord Morlie, the lord Darcie, sir William Windsore, sir
Hugh Caluerlie, sir Hugh Hastings, sir Hugh de la Sente, sir Thomas Percie, sir Thomas
Triuet, sir Hugh Tirell, sir William Farrington, sir Iohn and sir Nicholas Daubriticourt,
Thomas Camois, Rafe Neuill sonne to the lord Neuill, sir Henrie bastard Ferrers, sir
Hugh Broe, sir Geffrie Wourslie, sir William Clinton, sir Iuon Fitz Warren, and diuerse
other. After they had rested them at Calis two daies, they remooued the third day out of
the towne, and came to Marqueignes, where they remained thrée daies, till all their companie,
cariages, and prouisions were come to them out of Calis: from thence they remooued
and came before Arde, where the earle of Buckingham made knights these that
follow: the earle of Deuonshire, the lord Morlie, the son of the lord Fitz Walter, sir Roger
Strange, sir Iohn Ipre, sir Iohn Colle, sir Iames Tirell, sir Thomas Ramston, sir Iohn
Neuill, and sir Thomas Ros or Roslie, as some copies haue. These persons were made <span class="xxpn" id="p730">|730|</span>
knights, bicause they went in the vaward, which was sent to win a strong house called
Follant, which the owner had fortified against them. But though he defended himselfe
manfullie for a time, yet in the end both he and all his companie were taken prisoners.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Knights againe made.</p>

<p>The iournie of the English armie through France.</p></div>

<p>After this the duke passed by saint Omers, shewing himselfe (about a mile off) with his
host in order of battell aloft vpon a mounteine. Some of the Englishmen rode to the
barriers, requiring that some of them within would come foorth and breake staues with
them, but they could not be answered. The same day that the Englishmen thus came
before S. Omers, the earle of Buckingham made againe new knights, as sir Rafe Neuill, sir
Bartholomew Bourchier, sir Thomas Camois, sir Foulke Corbet, sir Thomas Danglure, sir
Rafe Petipas, sir Lewes saint Albine, and sir Iohn Paulie or rather Paulet. These
Englishmen rode through the countrie, demanding iusts and déeds of armes, but they could
not be answered. In déed the townes of the frontiers were well replenished and
stuffed with men of war, and still were the Englishmen coasted, but they kept themselues
so close togither, without breaking their order, that their enimies could find them at none
aduantage.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>They passed by Tirwine and by Betwine, where they lodged one day. They made but
easie iournies, and seemed to require nothing but battell. They passed by Arras, by
Miramont, and so to Clerie on the water of Some, and taried there thrée daies, and in
other places about in that countrie. The fourth day they dislodged, and drew towards
Cambraie, and so to S. Quintines, &amp; after vp towards Reimes. They found little riches,
and small store of vittels abroad in the countrie, for the French king had abandoned all to
his men of warre, who either wasted or conueied all things of any value into the fortresses
and walled townes. The Englishmen therefore sent to them of Reimes, requiring to haue
some vittels sent to the host, for the which they would spare the countrie from wasting:
but they of Reimes would not consent herevnto. Whervpon the Englishmen began to
light them such candels, as their eies within the citie aked to behold the same a far off.</p>

<p>Moreouer, the Englishmen approched so néere to the walles and diches of the citie,
that they brought awaie twentie thousand head of cattell, which the citizens had gotten
within the compasse of their diches; and further sent to them within, that if they would
not sent bread and wine foorth to vittell the host, in that behalfe they would burne all
their corne: for doubt whereof, the citizens sent foorth to the host six charets laden with
as much bread and wine as they might carie. Thus was their corne saued from destruction,
and the Englishmen by soft and easie iournies drew towards the citie of Trois, in the
which was the duke of Burgognie, with the dukes of Burbon and Bar, the earle of Ewe,
the lord Coucie, sir Iohn de Vien high admerall of France, and a great number of others
of the French nobilitie. They had made a bastide without the towne able to receiue a
thousand men of armes, but vpon the Englishmens approch to assault it, they did forsake
that strength, and withdrew to the towne. Sir Thomas Triuet was here made a baronet.
Also there were certeine new knights made, as sir Peter Berton, sir Iohn and sir Thomas
Paulie or Paulet, sir Iohn Stiugulie, sir Thomas Dortingues, sir Iohn Vassecoque, sir
Thomas Brasie, sir Iohn Brauin, sir Henrie Vernier, sir Iohn Coleuile, sir William Euerat,

<p>The English host perceiuing the Frenchmen to withdrawe into the towne, drew togither,
and stood in order of battell for the space of two houres, and then returned to their lodgings.
The next day they remooued to Maillerois le vicount neere vnto Sens, and there
they remained two daies, and after drew into Gastinois, and so into Beause. They were
coasted all the waie by a great power of men of war, as many or more in number as they
were themselues. But the French king being a politike prince, wiselie considered what
losses the realme of France had susteined afore time, by giuing battell to the Englishmen,
and therefore was fullie resolued, that in no wise he would giue licence to his people to
fight with the earle of Buckingham; but thought better (as he had learned by good <span class="xxpn" id="p731">|731|</span>
experience) to keepe his townes close against his enimies, and so in the end to wearie
them, than by giuing battell to put things in hazard, whereas he knew they could not
take from him his countries by this kind of warre, though they sore indamaged the same
for a time.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

forward, holding on their voiage towards Britaine by Vandosme, Pont Volaine, and so
ouer the riuer of Sartre. In this meane while the French king Charles the fift was taken
with a sore sicknesse, whereof he departed this life the same daie that the English armie

about the latter end of Iune, by a fléet of Englishmen of the west countries part of them

came short to their vessels againe, losing sometimes an hundred, sometimes fourescore

they came to Vitrie, a towne situate at the first entring into that countrie, and from
thence went to Chateau Briant, and there rested, whither came to them certeine knights
sent from the duke of Britaine, which signified to the erle of Buckingham what the dukes
meaning was. Indéed by the death of the French king, the dukes malice was greatlie
abated towards the Frenchmen, so that he had not much passed if the Englishmen had
béene at home againe. Moreouer, his townes were not determined to receiue the Englishmen,
as enimies to the crown of France: so that he was in a perplexitie how to order
his businesse. At length, to shew himselfe a stedfast fréend to the Englishmen, and one
that was no changeling, he determined by their support, to force all those to allow the
league which he had established with the Englishmen, who had denied to beare armour
against the crowne of France. And first, bicause they of Naunts were the ringleaders of
that rebellious demeanour, he appointed first to besiege their citie. They hauing knowledge

six hundred speares with all spéed to strengthen them of Naunts, which defended the citie
in such wise from the puissance of the Englishmen, who enuironed the same with a strong
siege, that in the end, bicause the duke came not to them (according to his promise)
the siege was raised the morrow after New yeares daie, two moneths and foure daies after
the same was first laid. The duke of Britaine would gladlie haue come to the siege of
Naunts, in strengthening of the English host, but he could not persuade his lords to aid

nephue the king of England. But the duke still excused him by his subiects, as though
if he had not thus agreed, he should haue beene in danger to haue lost his heritage of that
countrie. Finallie, the earle after he had ships prouided for his passage, the eleuenth

it being valued at seuen thousand marks. Herevpon the Scots entring by the west borders,
inuaded &amp; spoiled the countries of Westmerland and Cumberland, and comming
into the forrest of Inglewood, they tooke awaie with them such a number of beasts and
cattell, that they were reckoned at fourtie thousand heads of one and other. Besides
this, they cruellie slue all such as they could laie hands vpon, and burnt vp all the townes,
and houses as they passed: and not content herewith, they stale vpon the towne
of Penreth, when the faire was kept there, slaieng, taking, and chasing awaie the people,
and after gathering togither all the goods and riches there found, tooke it awaie with them,
whereof there was such plentie as might haue satisfied the couetous desire of a most greedie
armie. They returned by Carleil, but hearing that there were gotten into it a great number
of men out of the countries adioining, they durst not staie to make any attempt against
that towne, but compassed their waie to escape with their booties home into their countrie,
which they did, although they lost some of their companie as they passed by an ambushment
of certeine archers of Westmerland and Cumberland, that were laid for them
of purpose. When the earle of North­um­ber­land would haue gone foorth to reuenge those
iniuries doone to the countrie by the Scots, he was written to from the king and his councell,
to forbeare till the daie of truce, at what time it might be knowen what was further
to be doone in the matter.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>About Michaelmasse the duke of Lancaster, the earles of Warwike, and Stafford, with
other lords and men of honor, hauing with them a great power of souldiers and men of
warre, went into the north parts, and comming to the borders, they laie there till they
had consumed no small summes of monie, and indamaged the countrie as much as if the
Scotish armie had inuaded the same. The good they did, was, that after long treatie with
the Scotish com­mis­sion­ers, a truce was agreed vpon till Easter following, which being
concluded, they returned home without any more adoo. For the space of halfe a score
yeares togither now last past, the Englishmen euerie yeare had one or two such treaties

<p>Whilest the armie (as ye haue heard) laie idle in the north parts, there were certeine
letters found by a poore man about London, who deliuered them vnto the worthie citizen
Iohn Philpot, who calling vnto him certeine other worshipfull citizens, opened one of

it belonged vnto sir Rafe Ferrers knight, one of the kings priuie councell, deliuered that
letter with foure other letters closed with the same seale, first to the lord chancellor,
and after to the king, the which being read and the seale knowne to be the said sir Rafe
Ferrers his seale, manie greatlie maruelled that so ancient a knight, and one in whom so
great trust was put, should go about any such treasons.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>One of the letters was directed to sir Bertram de Cleaquin, an other to the lord de la
Riuer the chamberlaine of France, an other to the lord Clisson, and an other to the patrone
of the gallies, and to the capteine of the armie of Frenchmen and Spaniards, which
at the same time wafting alongst the coasts, did much hurt in diuerse places of the land.
Foorthwith the said Philpot and others were sent in post from the king to the duke of
Lancaster, that for somuch as the said sir Rafe Ferrers was then in the north parts with
him, intreating with the Scots, he should arrest him and put him in safe kéeping, which
commandement the duke did accomplish, and committed him to be safelie kept in the
castell of Duresme, but shortlie after in the next parlement he was set at libertie, foure <span class="xxpn" id="p734">|734|</span>

to come where there was no store of fewell to make them fiers: and beside that, lodgings
were verie streict for so great a multitude. But the cause that mooued the councell to

the triall of Iohn Kirkbie a citizen of London, that had murthered the Genowais (as
before ye haue hard) which Kirkbie was condemned at this parlement, and drawne and
hanged in the sight of the Londoners that were come thither, which execution if it

<p>About this time did Iohn Wicliffe chieflie set foorth his opinion touching the sacrament
of the altar, denieng the doctrine of tran­sub­stan­tia­tion, and that it ought not in
any wise to be worshipped in such sort as the church of Rome then did teach.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ There</span>
were ambassadors sent into Germanie, to treat with the emperour for a marriage to be
had, betwixt the king of England, and the emperours sister. About the beginning of
March they returned, bringing with them the cardinall, intituled of saint Praxed, and
the duke of Tarsilia, and other nobles that came from the emperor, to treat with the
king &amp; his councell about the same marriage. This cardinall, whether he passed the
bounds of his commission and authoritie to him granted by the pope (as some write) or
whether he was furnished with such faculties, he was very liberall in bestowing of them
abrode on all such as would come with monie. Indulgences, which the pope had vsed
onelie to reserue for himselfe to bestow, this man granted the same liberallie, both biennals
and triennals. He gaue also letters confessionall, to all those that would
paie for them, admitting aswell beneficed men as other, to be the popes chapleins.
He made notaries for monie, and denied not altars portatiue to anie that would pay
for them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>He receiued fortie pounds, besides other gifts, of the moonks of the Cisteaux order, to
grant to them a generall licence to eat flesh indifferentlie, as well abroad, as they had
béene accustomed to doo at home within their monasteries. To those that were excommunicate
he gaue absolution: those that had vowed to go in pilgrimage to Rome, to the
holie land, or to saint Iames, he would not first release them, till he had receiued so much
monie, according to the true valuation, as they should haue spent in their iornies: and to
be bréefe, nothing could be asked, but for monie he was readie to grant it. And when he
was requested to shew by what power he did all these things, with great indignation he
answered, that he would let them vnderstand at Rome, if they would needs know the
authoritie which he had. At length his males were so filled with siluer, that his seruants
disdained to make them anie answer, except they brought gold, saieng; “Bring vs gold, <span class="xxpn" id="p735">|735|</span>

<p>An armie sent into Portingale to aid the king there against the K.

<p>But now to returne to other matters concerning the state of the realme. After the returne
of the earle of Buckingham, it was ordeined by aduise of the councell, that the duke
of Lancaster should eftsoones go as ambassador from king Richard into Scotland, to see if
he might renew the truce (which shortlie would haue beene expired) for three yéeres longer.
Also whereas there was variance and open war mainteined, betwixt Iohn king of Castile,
and king Iohn of Portingale, the earle of Cambridge, the lord William de Beauchampe,
the lord Botreux, and sir Matthew Gournie, were sent into Portingale with fiue hundred
armed men, and fiue hundred archers to aid the king of Portingale against the king of
Castile, who was sonne to the bastard Henrie: for the duke of Lancaster reioised greatlie,
that he might haue such a fréend as the king of Portingale, to ioine with him in aid against
the king of Castile; meaning (as soone as opportunity would serue) to go ouer with an
armie to chalenge his right, and pursue his claime to the crowne of Castile and Leon,
against the vsurper, in right of his wife quéene Constance, eldest daughter to the late lawfull

<p>It was meant therefore that if the duke of Lancaster could compasse his purpose, for the
which he went at that time into Scotland, to the honour of the king and realme, then
should he shortlie after follow his brother of Cambridge with a great power, to trie what
chance God would send to him, against his aduersarie the king of Castile.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ In</span> the

to the disquieting of the same, and vtter disappointing for that time of the duke of Lancasters

that were demanded of them, by reason of the grant made in parlement (as yée haue
heard) but also (as some write) for that they were sore oppressed (as they tooke the matter)
by their land-lords, that demanded of them their ancient customes and seruices, set
on by some diuelish instinct &amp; persuasion of their owne beastlie intentions, as men not
content with the state wherevnto they were called, rose in diuerse parts of this realme, and
assembled togither in companies, purposing to inforce the prince to make them frée and
to release them of all seruitude, whereby they stood as bondmen to their lords and superiours.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The beginning of the rebellion at Derford in Kent.</p></div>

<p>Where this rebellion of the commons first began, diuerse haue written diuerslie. One
author writeth, that (as he learned by one that was not farre from the place at that time)
the first beginning should be at Dertford in Kent: for when those pole shillings, or rather
(as other haue) pole grotes, were to be collected, no small murmuring, curssing, and repining
among the common people rose about the same, and the more indeed, through
the lewd demenour of some vndiscréet officers, that were assigned to the gathering thereof,
insomuch that one of those officers being appointed to gather vp that monie in Dertford
aforesaid, came to the house of one Iohn Tiler, that had both seruants in his house, and a
faire yong maid to his daughter. The officer there fore demanding monie for the said Tiler
and for his wife, his seruants, and daughter, the wife being at home, and hir husband
abroad at worke in the towne, made answer that hir daughter was not of age, and therefore
she denied to paie for hir.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Now here is to be noted, that this monie was in common speech said to be due for all
those that were vndergrowne, bicause that yoong persons as well of the man as of the
womankind, comming to the age of fouretéene or fifteene yeares, haue commonlie haire
growing foorth about those priuie parts, which for honesties sake nature hath taught vs to
couer and keepe secret. The officer therefore not satisfied with the mothers excuse, said <span class="xxpn" id="p736">|736|</span>
he would feele whether hir daughter were of lawfull age or not, and therewith began to
misuse the maid, and search further than honestie would haue permitted. The mother
streightwaies made an outcrie, so that hir husband being in the towne at worke, and hearing
of this adoo at his house, came running home with his lathing staffe in his hand, and
began to question with the officer, asking who made him so bold to keepe such a rule in
his house: the officer being somewhat presumptuous, and highminded, would foorthwith
haue flowne vpon this Tiler; but I. Tiler auoiding the officers blow, raught him such a
rap on the pate, that his braines flue out, and so presentlie he died.</p>

<p>Great noise rose about this matter in the stréets, and the poore folks being glad, euerie
man arraied himselfe to support Iohn Tiler, &amp; thus the commons drew togither, and went
to Maidestone, and from thence to Blackheath, where their number so increased, that they
were reckoned to be thirtie thousand. And the said Iohn Tiler tooke vpon him to be
their cheefe capteine, naming himselfe Iacke Straw.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ Others</span> write, that one Thomas
Baker of Fobbings was the first that procured the people thus to assemble togither: and
that one of the kings seruants named Iohn Leg, with three of his fellowes, practised to
féele yoong maids whether they were vndergrowne (as yée haue hard the officer did at
Dertford) which dishonest and vnséemelie kind of dealing did set the people streight
in such a rage and vprore, that they cared not what they did to be reuenged of such
iniuries.</p>

<p>The commōs of Essex begin the commotiō as <i>Wal.</i> saith.</p>

<p>The armor of <span class="nowrap">y<sup>e</sup></span> Essex rebels.</p></div>

<p>But Thomas Walsingham affirmeth, that the first sparkes of this rebellion kindled in
Essex, where the inhabitants of two townes onelie at the first, that were the authors and
first stirrers of all this mischéefe, did send vnto euerie little towne about, that all manner
of men, as well those that were aged, as others that were in their lustiest time and youthfull
yeares, should come to them with speed, setting all excuses apart, in their best arraie
and furniture for warre, threatning to such as came not, that their goods should be spoiled,
their houses burnt or cast downe, and they to lose their heads when they were taken.
The terror of this threatning caused the ignorant people to flocke to them by heaps, leauing
all their businesse, letting plough and cart stand, forsaking wife, children, and houses,
so that in a short time there were fiue thousand gotten togither of those commons and
husbandmen, of which number manie were weaponed onelie with staues, some with rustie
swords and billes, and other with smokie bowes, more ruddie than old yuorie, not hauing
past two or thrée arrowes, and the same happilie with one feather a peece.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Among a thousand of those kind of persons, yée should not haue séene one well armed:
and yet by reason of their multitude, when they were once got togither, they thought the
whole relme had not beene able to resist them; and supposed that they could with facilitie
(in respect of the aduerse part) make the states of the land stoope to them, and by their
permission to reteine or compulsion to resigne their roomes of dignitie. But the fond
conceited rowt considered not the euent of this insurrection, that the woorst would be
their owne; for the old saieng is true, namelie,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Moreouer,
to make their part the stronger, these Essexmen sent ouer into Kent, aduertising
the people there of their enterprise, and therefore willed them to make them readie
to ioine with them for their obteining of libertie, and reforming of the euill customs of the
realme. Whether the Kentishmen through persuasions of their neighbors of Essex, by
occasion of that which had chanced at Dertford (as before yée haue heard) or (as it may
be) the same chancing at that selfe time, they being mooued as well by the one as the
other, vp they got (as yée haue heard) and gathering their power out of the next quarters
adioining by the like policie which had béene practised by the Essexmen, they stirred vp
the most part of the countrie to ioine with them, and foorthwith stopping the waie that
led to Canturburie, and arresting all such as passed by the same, they caused them to
swere that they should be true to king Richard, and to the commons, &amp; neuer to receiue
anie king that should be called Iohn. And this was for the enuie which they bare to Iohn <span class="xxpn" id="p737">|737|</span>
of Gant the duke of Lancaster, who in right of his wife Constance, that was daughter to
king Peter of Castile, did name himselfe king

<p>Also they caused them to sweare that they should be readie to come to them whensoeuer

that they should neuer yéeld to anie tax to be leuied on the realme, except a fiftéenth
onelie. Thus it came to passe, that after it was spred abroad what stur these Essex and
Kentishmen kept; the commons also in the counties of Sussex, Hertford, Cambridge,
Suffolke, and Norffolke, and other shires about, bustled vp and ran togither on heapes, so
that the number of those vnrulie people maruellouslie increased, in such wise as now they
feared no resistance, and therefore began to shew proofe of those things which they had
before conceiued in their minds, beheading all such men of law, iustices, and iurors, as
they might catch, and laie hands vpon, without respect of pitie, or remorse of conscience,
alledging that the land could neuer enioy hir natiue and true libertie, till all those sorts of

mind, their landlords might not haue whereby to chalenge anie right at their hands.
Their number still increased: for all such as were in debt or danger of law for their misdemeanors
and offenses, came out of all coasts vnto them, so that when the Essexmen,
and other of the hither side the Thames, were passed ouer and ioined with the Kentishmen,
&amp; those that were assembled on that side the riuer vpon Blackeheath; they were
estéemed to be an hundred thousand, hauing diuerse capteins besides the said Iacke
Straw, as William Wraw, Wat Tiler, Iacke Shéepheard, Tom Milner, and Hob Carter.
Whilest they were lodged on Blackheath, the king sent to them certeine knights, to vnderstand
of them the cause of their gathering thus togither, to whom answer was made, that
they were come togither to speake with the king about certeine causes and businesse, &amp;
therefore they bad the messengers returne, and declare to the king that there was no remedie
but he must needs come and speake with them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>When this tale was told to the king, there were some that thought it best that he should

Canturburie, that was lord chancellor, and also sir Robert Hales lord of S. Iohns, and
as then lord treasuror, spake earnestlie against that aduise, and would not by anie meanes
that the king should go to such a sort of barelegged ribalds; but rather they wished that
he should take some order to abate the pride of such vile rascals. After the commons
vnderstood that the king would not come to them, by reason of the contrarie aduise giuen
to him by those two persons, the lord chancellor and the lord treasuror, they were maruellouslie

went downe the riuer in his barge to Rethereth, and there néere the shore keeping himselfe
still on the water, talked with a great number of them that came downe to the riuer side.
But forsomuch as he would not come foorth of his barge to them on land, which they
seemed most to desire, they were in a great rage, and so for that they could not haue him
amongst them (as they wished) in furious wise they ran to the citie, and at the first approach

seemed to fauour the cause of the rebels so apparantlie, that they threatned to kill both

The Londoners liked better of the commons, for that they protested the cause of
their assembling togither, was not but to seeke out the traitors of the realme, and when
they had found them foorth, and punished them according to that they had deserued, they

togither, and were heard of manie, but none came to helpe them, and so finallie they
perished. Now after that these wicked people had thus destroied the duke of Lancasters
house, and done what they could deuise to his reproch; they went to the temple, and
burnt the men of lawes lodgings, with their bookes, writings, and all that they might lay
hand vpon. Also the house of saint Iohns by Smithfield they set on fire, so that it burned
for the space of seuen daies togither. On Friday a great number of them, estéemed to 20
thousand, went to the manor of Heiburie that belonged vnto the lord of saint Iohns, and
setting fire on it, sought vtterlie to destroie the whole buildings about it.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>They were now diuided into thrée parts, one vnder the leading of Iacke Straw, tooke in

third companie kept vpon the tower hill, and would not suffer anie vittels to be conueied

rude people, that he suffered them to enter into the tower, where they sought so narowlie
for the lord chancelor, that finding him in the chappell, they drew him foorth togither with
the lord treasuror, and on the tower hill without reuerence of their estates and degrees,
with great noise and fell cries, they stroke off their heads. There were also beheaded at
the same time by those rude people, one of the kings seruants that was a sergeant at armes <span class="xxpn" id="p739">|739|</span>
called Iohn Leg, who had vsed himselfe somewhat extremelie in gathering vp of the pole

<p>On the same day also they beheaded manie others, as well Englishmen as Flemings, for

Neither had they any regard to sacred places;
for breaking into the church of
the Augustine friers, they drew foorth thirteene Flemings, and beheaded them in the open

they brake vp their houses, murthered them which they found within, and spoiled their
goods in most outragious manner. Likewise they entered into churches (as before ye
haue heard) into abbeies, monasteries, and other houses, namelie of men of law, which in
semblable sort they ransacked. They also brake vp the prisons of newgate, and of both
the counters, destroied the books, and set prisoners at libertie, and also the sanctuarie-men
of saint Martins le grand. And so likewise did they at Westminster, where they brake
open the eschequer, and destroied the ancient bookes and other records there, dooing

<p>They that entered the tower, vsed themselues most pre­sump­tuous­lie, and no lesse vnreuerentlie

chamber, they offered to kisse her, and swasht downe vpon hir bed, putting hir into such
feare, that she fell into a swoone, and being taken vp and recouered, was had to the water
side, and put into a barge, &amp; conueied to the place called the quéenes wardrobe, or the
tower riall, where she remained all that day and the night following, as a woman halfe dead,
till the king came to recomfort hir. It was strange to consider, in what feare the lords,
knights &amp; gentlemen stood of the cruell proceedings of those rude &amp; base people. For

<p>Finallie, when they had eased their stomachs, with the spoiling, burning, and defacing of
sundrie places, they became more quiet, and the king by the aduise of such as were then
about him, vpon good deliberation of counsell, offered to them pardon, and his peace,
with condition that they should cease from burning and ruinating of houses, from killing
and murthering of men, and depart euerie man to his home without more adoo, and there
to tarrie for the kings charters confirmatorie of the same pardon. The Essexmen were
content with this offer, as they that were desirous to see their wiues and children, being
waxen wearie of continuall trauell and paines which they were constreined to take. The
king went foorth vnto Mile end, and there declared vnto the commons that they should
haue charters made to them of his grant, to make them all free. And further that euerie
shire, towne, lordship and libertie should haue banners of his armes deliuered vnto them,
for a confirmation of his grant. Herevpon they séemed well appeased, and the king rode <span class="xxpn" id="p740">|740|</span>
to the queenes wardrobe, otherwise called the tower roiall, to visit his mother, and so did
comfort hir so well as he could, and taried with hir there all night.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The Essexmen satisfied with the kings promises, immediatlie departed homeward; howbeit
they appointed certeine of their companie to remaine still and tarie for the kings charters.
The Kentishmen also remained, and were as busie in maner the next day being
saturdaie, in all kind of mischiefous dealings, as they had béene before, to wit, in murthering
of men, ouerthrowing and burning of houses. The king therefore sent vnto them such
as declared in what sort their fellowes were gone home well satisfied, &amp; from thencefoorth
to liue in quiet, and the same forme of peace he was contented to grant to them, if it liked
them to accept the same. Herevpon their chéefe capteine Wat Tiler, a verie craftie fellow,
and indued with much wit (if he had well applied it) said, that peace indeed he wished,
but yet so, as the conditions might be indited to his purpose.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The wicked purpose of the rebels.</p>

<p>The rebels would haue all law abolished.</p></div>

<p>He was determined to driue off the king and his councell (bicause he was of greater
force than they) with cauils and shifts till the next daie, that in the night following he
might the more easilie haue compassed his resolution, which was, hauing all the poorer sort
of the citie on his side, to haue spoiled the citie, and to set fire in foure corners of it, killing
first the king and the lords that were about him: but he that resisteth the proud, and
giueth his grace to the humble, would not permit the vngratious deuises of the naughtie and
lewd lozzell to take place, but suddenlie disappointed his mischeefous drift. For whereas
diuerse formes of charters had béene drawne according to the effect of the agréement with
the Essexmen, and none of them might please this lordlie rebell,
at length the king sent
to him one of his knights called sir Iohn Newton, to request him to come to him, that they
might talke of the articles which he stood vpon to haue inserted in the charter, of the
which one was to haue had a commission to put to death all lawiers, escheaters, and other
which by any office had any thing to doo with the law; for his meaning was that hauing
made all those awaie that vnderstood the lawes, all things should then be ordered according
to the will and disposition of the common people. It was reported in deed, that he
should saie with great pride the day before these things chanced, putting his hands to his
lips, that within foure daies all the lawes of England should come foorth of his mouth.
The wretches had vtterlie forgotten all law, both diuine and humane; otherwise they
would haue béene content to liue vnder law, and to doo vnto others as they would be
doone vnto, as the verie law of nature (than which there cannot be a better guide)

answered as it were with indignation: “If thou (saith he) hast so much hast to returne
to the king, thou maist depart, I will come at my pleasure.” When the knight therefore
was come from him, he followed indéed, but somwhat slowlie. And when he was come
néere to the place in Smithfield where the king then was, with certeine lords and knights,
&amp; other companie about him, the said sir Iohn Newton was sent to him againe, to vnderstand
what he meant. And bicause the knight came to him on horssebacke, &amp; did not
alight from his horsse, Wat Tiler was offended, &amp; said in his furie, “that it became
him rather on foot than horssebacke to approach into his presence.” The knight not
able to abide such presumptuous demeanour in that proud and arrogant person, shaped
him this answer: “It is not amisse that I being on horssebacke, should come to thée

<p>With which words Wat Tiler taking indignation, drew out his dagger, menacing to strike
the knight, calling him therewith traitor: the knight disdaining to be misvsed at the hands
of such a ribald, told him that he lied falselie, and with that plucked foorth his dagger.
Wat Tiler being among his men, shewed that he would not beare that iniurie, and foorthwith
made towards the knight to run vpon him. The king perceiuing the knight in danger, <span class="xxpn" id="p741">|741|</span>
bad him alight from his horsse, and deliuer his dagger to Wat Tiler:
but when that would
not pacifie his proud and high mind, but that he would néeds flée vpon him, the maior of
London William Walworth, and other knights and esquiers that were about the king, told
him that it should be a shame for them all, if they permitted the knight in their presence
before the eies of their prince so to be murthered: wherfore they gaue counsell to succor
him foorthwith, and to apprehend the vile naughtie ribald. The king though he was but
a child in yeares, yet taking courage to him, commanded the maior to arrest him. The
maior being a man of incomparable boldnesse, foorthwith rode to him and arrested him,
in reaching him such a blow on the head, that he sore astonied him therewith: and
streightwaies other that were about the king, as Iohn Standish an esquier, and diuers
more of the kings seruants drew their swords, and thrust him through in diuerse parts of

and so bending their bowes, made them readie to shoot. The king shewing both hardinesse
and wisdome at that instant, more than his age required, set his spurs to his horsse,
and rode to them, saieng: “What is the matter my men, what meane you? Will you shoot
at your king? Be not troubled nor offended at the death of a traitor and ribald; I will be
your king, capteine and leader, follow me into the fields, and you shall haue all things

should haue set fire on the houses there in Smithfield, and haue attempted some further
mischéefe, in reuenge of the displeasure which they tooke for the death of their chéefe
leader. They mooued with these the kings words, followed him and the knights that were
with him, into the open fields, not yet resolued whether they should set vpon the king and
slea him, or else be quiet, and returne home with the kings charter.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>In the meane time, the lord maior of London was returned into the citie, with one man
onelie attending vpon him, and cried to the citizens; “Oh yée good and vertuous citizens,
come foorth out of hand, and helpe your king readie to be slaine, &amp; helpe me your maior
standing in the same perill; or if yée will not helpe me for some faults committed by me
against you, yet forsake not your king, but helpe and succour him in this present danger.”
When the worshipfull citizens and other, that in their loiall hearts loued the king, had
heard these words, in­con­ti­nent­lie they put themselues in strong and sure armor, to the
number of a thousand men, and gathering themselues togither into the streets, tarried but
for some lord or knight that might conduct them to the king: and by chance there came
vnto them sir Robert Knolles, whom all of them requested that he would be their leader,
least comming out of arraie and order, they might the sooner be broken, who willinglie
led one part of them, and certeine other knights led other of them, clad in faire bright
armour vnto the kings presence. The king with the lords, knights and esquires, not a
little reioised at the comming of those armed men, and streightwaies compassed the commons
about, as they had beene a flocke of sheepe that should haue béene closed within
some fold, till it pleased the sheepheard to appoint foorth, which should be thrust into
pasture, and which taken to go to the shambels.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

wholie and altogither in their hands, power, and disposition. The poore wretches
sought to hide themselues in the corne that grew in the fields, in ditches, hedges and
dennes, and wheresoeuer they might get out of the way, so to safe gard their liues. The
knights that were with the king would gladlie haue beene dooing with them, and requested
licence of him to strike off the heads of some one or two hundred of them, that
it might be a witnesse in time to come, that the force of the order of knighthood was able <span class="xxpn" id="p742">|742|</span>
to doo somewhat against the carters and ploughmen: but the king would not suffer them,
alledging that manie of them were come thither by compulsion, and not of their owne
accord, and therefore it might come to passe that those should die for it, that had nothing
offended: but he commanded that there should be proclamation made in London, that
the citizens should haue no dealings with them, nor suffer anie of them to come within
the citie that night, but to cause them to lie without doores.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p><i>Abraham Fleming</i> out of <i>Henrie Knighton</i>
canon of Leicester abbeie.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ In</span> the report of this commotion chronographers doo somewhat varie, as by this present
extract out of Henrie Knighton canon of Leceister abbeie, liuing at the time of this
tumult may appeare: which Abraham Fleming hath faithfullie and trulie translated out
of the annales of the said canon written in parchment in old Latine letters, as followeth.
Vpon a saturdaie, these malcontents [to wit, Thomas Baker the first moouer but afterwards
the principall leaders, Iacke Straw, Iacke Miler, Iacke Carter, Iacke Trewman,
and their trecherous traine] met togither in Smithfield, whither also the king repaired
in the morning, who although in yeares he was but yoong, yet in wisedome and discretion
he was well growne. The ringleader of this tumultuous rowt, whose right name was
Wat Tiler, which he had now changed into Iacke Strawe, approched neere the king, in
so much that he might in a maner touch him, being the mouth of all the residue, and
hauing in his hand a drawne dagger, which he tossed from hand to hand, boy-like plaieng
with it, &amp; watching due time therewith, if not to stab, yet suddenlie to smite the king,
if he denied their requests. Wherevpon they that were next and about the king were
greatlie affeard, least his pretended mischéefe should come to passe.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Now he craued of the king that all warrens, waters, parks and woods should be common,
so that as well poore as rich might fréelie in any place wheresoeuer practise fishing
in ponds, pooles, riuers, or any waters, and might hunt déere in forrests and parkes, and
the hare in the fields, with diuerse other requests, which he would haue granted without
contradiction or gainesaieng, and exercise without controlment. Now when the king
in the grant hereof by deliberation vsed some delaie, Iacke Straw drew neerer vnto him,
and speaking vnto him certeine thretening words, tooke hold of the horsses bridle whereon
the king rode, vpon what presumptuous enterprise I wot not. Which Iohn Walworth
a burgesse of London beholding, and fearing present death to hang ouer the kings head,
caught a weapon in his hand, and therwith thrust Iacke Straw through the throte, which
when another that was by being an esquier, name Rafe Standish did see, with his weapon
also ran him through the sides; in so much that he fell flat on his backe to the ground,
and beating with his hands to and fro a while, at last he gaue vp his vnhappie ghost.</p>

<p>Then a great clamor and lamentable outcrie was made, and heard a great while togither,
saieng; Our guide is dead, our capteine is dead. And indéed so he was, being
dragged by the hands and féet in a vile and contemptible sort into saint Bartholomewes
church hard by. Then did manie of the vnrulie multitude withdraw themselues, and vanishing
awaie betooke them to their héeles, being about the number (as it was thought)
of ten thousand. Then the king minding to make amends and to requite receiued courtesie,
knighted the said Iohn Walworth, &amp; Rafe Standish, with foure burgesses more of
the citie, namelie Iohn Philpot, Nicholas Brembre, Iohn Laund, and Nicholas Twifield,
girding them about the wast with the girdle of knighthood, which was the maner of their
graduating. Then the king hauing ordeined and made the foresaid six knights, commanded
that the residue of the curssed crue should depart and get them into the field,
that méeting togither in a companie, he might fall vnto a treatie of agreement with them.</p>

<p>The rowt being there assembled, behold a multitude of armed men ran rusling out of
the citie, sir Robert Knols being their capteine, who with these his soldiers compassed
&amp; hedged in the poore catiues distressed in the field like shéepe that haue lost their
shéepheard. Then the king of his accustomed clemencie, being pricked with pitie, would
not that the wretches should die, but spared them being a rash and foolish multitude, and
commanded them euerie man to get him home to his owne house; howbeit manie of <span class="xxpn" id="p743">|743|</span>
them, at the kings going awaie suffered the danger of death. In this miserable taking
were reckoned to the number of twentie thousand. Thus saith Knighton, not as an eie-witnesse,
but as taught by heare-saie, whereby he compiled the greatest part of his annales,
as he himselfe confesseth, seeming sorrie that he was so constreined, as by part
of the octastichon at the foot of the first page, intituled Lamentum compilatoris, appeareth
in maner and forme following:</p>

<p class="pverse">Plus audita loquor quàm mihi visa sequor, &amp;c.</p>
</div></div>

<p>All the foresaid villanies not­with­stand­ing against the king and the state, tending wholie
to the subuersion of law and ciuill gouernement, albeit the wretches deserued no sparke
of fauour, but extreame seueritie of iudgement to be executed vpon them; yet (as yee
haue heard) besides the great clemencie of the king, exhibited vnto them in remitting
their offense, and acquiting them from the rigor of the law, he granted and gaue to them
the charter, which they had requested, faire written and sealed, to auoid a greater mischiefe,
&amp; commanded it for a time to be deliuered them, knowing that Essex and Kent
were not so pacified, but that if they were not the sooner contented, and that partlie after
their minds, they would vp againe. The tenor of the charter which was gotten thus by

after the townesmen were returned home, they kept such a coile against the abbat and

bicause such old charters as they requested were not to be had, the abbat and moonks
looked euerie houre when their house should be set on fire and burnt ouer their heads.
The prior and certeine other as well moonks as laie men that were seruants to the abbat,
fled for feare of the rage of those misgouerned people, knowing that they hated them
deadlie, and therefore looked for no courtesie at their hands. They had obteined the
kings letters vnto the abbat, commanding him to deliuer vnto them such charters as they
had giuen information to be remaining in his hands, so that vnder colour therof, they

to haue charters made to them by the abbat, of the like forme and effect to that

for his presumptuous intrusion into the abbacie of Burie.</p></div>

<p>Also sir Iohn of Cambridge the prior of saint Edmundsburie, as he would haue fled
from them, was taken not far from Mildenhale, and likewise beheaded, his bodie being
left naked in the open field, and no man presuming to burie it, during the space of fiue
daies, for feare of the cruell commons. His head was set vpon a pole, and caried before
Iohn Wraw and other of those wicked people; the which comming to Burie, and entring
the towne in maner of a procession, when they came into the market place where the
pillorie stood, as it were in token of the old friendship betwixt the lord chiefe iustice,
and the said prior, they made sport with their heads, making them sometime as it were
to kisse, other whiles to sound in either others eare. After they had taken their pastime
inough herewith, they set both the heads againe aloft vpon the pillorie. After this, they
beheaded an other moonke called Dan Iohn de Lakinghuith, whose hed was likewise set
by the other two vpon the pillorie. Moreouer, they caused the moonks to come foorth
and bring vnto them all such obligations, in which the townesmen stood bound vnto the
monasterie for their good abearing; likewise such charters of liberties of the towne of
Burie, which king Cnute the founder of the said monasterie, and his successors had
granted to the same: which writings, when they had brought foorth, and protested that
they knew of no more, the commons would scarselie beleeue them, and therefore called
the townesmen foorth, and bad them sée if that there were all such writings as they thought
stood with their aduantage to haue brought to light. The townesmen feigned as though
they had beene sorie to see such rule kept against the moonks, where in déed they had
set the commons in hand with all these things.
To conclude, the commons tooke this
order with the moonks, that if the townesmen might not obteine their ancient liberties,
by the hauing of those writings, they should declare what the same liberties were, which
they were woont to inioy, and the abbat of Burie, Edmund Brumfield, being then in
prison at Notingham whom they purposed to deliuer (so that he should celebrat diuine
seruice in his monasterie on Midsummer daie next) within fourtie daies after his comming
home, should confirme with his seale such charter as was to be deuised and made
concerning the same liberties of the said townesmen, and the couent should likewise put
therevnto their common seale.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Moreouer, they constreined the moonks to deliuer vnto the townesmen, a crosse and <span class="xxpn" id="p745">|745|</span>
a chalice of fine gold, and other iewels that belonged to the abbeie, being in value aboue
the worth of a thousand pounds in monie, the which was to remaine in the hands of the
townsmen, vpon this condition, that if Edmund Brumfield being deliuered out of prison
inioied the dignitie of abbat there, and with all put his seale togither with the couent
seale within the time limited, vnto a writing that should conteine the liberties of the towne,
that then the same crosse, chalice, and other iewels should be restored vnto the monasterie,
or else the same to remaine for euer to the townesmen as forfeited. Such were
the dooings of those rebels in and about the towne of Burie: and the like disorders &amp;
breach of peace followed by the commotions of the commons in Cam­bridge­shire, and in
the Ile of Elie, resembling the others in slaughters of men, destroieng of houses, and all
other sorts of mischéefe.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>In like maner in Norffolke there was assembled an huge number of those vnrulie countrie
people, which vnder the guiding of a dier of cloth, commonlie called Iohn Littester,
that had dwelt in Norwich, attempted and did all such vngratious feats, as they had heard
that other did in other parts of the realme, yea and greater also, putting foorth their hands
vnto rapine and robberie.
And whereas they were wholie conspired togither, and bent
to commit all kind of mischéefe, yet estéeming their owne authoritie to be small, they
purposed to haue brought William Vfford earle of Suffolke into their fellowship, that if
afterwards they might happilie be impeached hereafter, for such their naughtie and most
wicked dooings, they might haue had some shadow or colour, as it were through him,
whie they had delt in such vnrulie sort. But the earle aduertised of their intention, suddenlie
rose from supper, and got him awaie by vnknowne waies, still fleeing from the
commons, till at length he got to S. Albons, and so from thence to the king.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The commons missing of their purpose for the hauing of him, laid hold vpon all such
knights and other gentlemen as came in their waie, and were found at home in their
houses, compelling them to be sworne to them, and to ride with them through the countrie,
as the lord Scales, William lord Morlie, sir Iohn Brewes, sir Stephan Hales, and sir
Robert Salle: which sir Robert continued not long aliue among them, for he could not
dissemble as the residue, but began to reprooue openlie their naughtie dooings, for the
which he had his braines dasht out by a countrie clown, one that was his bondman, and
so he ended his life, who if he might haue come to haue tried his manhood and strength
with them in plaine battell, had beene able to haue put a thousand of those villaines in
feare, his valiancie and prowesse was such. The residue taught by his example that they
must either dissemble or die for it, were glad to currie fauour, praising or dispraising all
things as they saw the commons affected, and so comming into credit with their
chéefteine
Iohn Littester, that named himselfe king of the commons, they were preferred to
serue him at the table, in taking the assaie of his meats and drinks, and dooing other
seruices, with knéeling humblie before him as he sat at meat, as sir Stephan Hales who
was appointed his caruer, and others had other offices assigned them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A warlike bishop.</p></div>

<p>At length, when those commons began to wax wearie of taking paines in euill dooings,
they tooke counsell togither, and agreed to send two knights, to wit, the lord Morlie, and
sir Iohn Brewes, and three of the commons, in whom they put great confidence, vnto the
king; to obteine their charter of manumission and infranchising, and to haue the same
charter more large than those that were granted to other countries. They deliuered great
summes of monie vnto those whome they sent, to bestow the same for the obteining of
pardon, and such grants as they sued for, which monie they had got by force of the citizens
of Norwich, to saue the citie from fire and sacking.
These knights as they were on
their iournie, at Ichingham not farre distant from Newmarket, not looking for anie such
thing, met with sir Henrie Spenser bishop of Norwich, a man more fit for the field than
the church, &amp; better skilled (as may appéere) in arms than in diuinitie. This bishop had
ad­uer­tise­ments at his manor of Burlie néere to Okam in the parties about Stamford, of the
sturre which the commons in Norffolke kept, and therevpon resolued streightwaies to <span class="xxpn" id="p746">|746|</span>
see what rule there was holden. He had in his companie at that time, not passing eight
lances, and a small number of archers.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Spenser bish. of Norwich goeth as capteine against the rebels.</p></div>

<p>The bishop méeting thus with the knights, examined them streightwaies if there were
anie of the traitours there with them. The knights at the first were doubtfull to bewraie
their associats: but at last imboldened by the bishops words, declared that two of the
chéefe dooers in the rebellion were there present, and the third was gone to prouide for
their dinner. The bishop streightwaies commanded those two to be made shorter by the
head, and the third he himselfe went to seeke, as one of his shéepe that was lost; not to
bring him home to the fold, but to the slaughter-house, as he had well deserued (in the
bishops opinion) sith he had so mischéefouslie gone astraie, and alienated himselfe from
his dutifull allegiance. These persons being executed, and their heads pight on the end
of poles, and so set vp at Newmarket, the bishop with the knights tooke their waie with
all spéed towards Northwalsham in Norffolke, where the commons were purposed to staie
for answer from the king:
and as he passed through the countrie, his number increased,
for the knights and gentlemen of the countrie, hearing how their bishop had taken his
speare in hand, and was come into the field armed, ioined themselues with him.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The fortifieng of the rebels campe.</p>

<p>The bishop is the first man that chargeth the rebels in their campe.</p>

<p>The Norfolke rebels vanquished.</p></div>

<p>When therefore the bishop was come into the place where the commons were incamped,
he perceiued that they had fortified their campe verie stronglie with ditches, and such
other stuffe as they could make shift with, as doores, windowes, boords, &amp; tables, and
behind them were all their cariages placed, so that it séemed they meant not to flie.
Herewith the bishop being chafed with the presumptuous boldnesse of such a sort of
disordered persons, commanded his trumpets to sound to the battell, and with his speare
in the rest,
he charged them with such violence, that he went ouer the ditch, and laied
so about him, that through his manfull dooings, all his companie found meanes to passe
the ditch likewise, and so therewith followed a verie sore and terrible fight, both parts
dooing their best to vanquish the other. But finallie the commons were ouercome,
and
driuen to seeke their safegard by flight, which was sore hindered by their cariages that
stood behind them, ouer the which they were forced to clime and leape so well as they
might. Iohn Littester and other cheefe capteins were taken aliue. The bishop therefore
caused the said Littester to be arreigned of high treason, and condemned, and so he was
drawne, hanged, and headed according to the iudgement.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<h2 class="nobreak">An. Reg. 5.</h2></div>

<p>The bishop heard his confession, and by vertue of his office absolued him: and to shew
some parcell of sorrowing for the mans mischance, he went with him to the galowes. But
it séemed that pitie wrought not with the bishop, to quench the zeale of iustice: for he
caused not Littester onelie to be executed, but sought for all other that were the chéefe
dooers in that rebellion, causing them to be put vnto death, and so by that meanes quieted
the countrie.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ To</span> recite what was doone in euerie part of the realme in time of those
hellish troubles, it is not possible: but this is to be considered, that the rage of the commons
was vniuersallie such, as it might séeme they had generallie conspired togither, to
doo what mischeefe they could deuise.
As among sundrie other, what wickednesse was
it, to compell teachers of children in grammer schooles to sweare neuer to instruct any
in their art? Againe, could they haue a more mischeefous meaning, than to burne and
destroie all old and ancient monuments, and to murther and dispatch out of the waie all
such as were able to commit to memorie, either any new or old records? For it was
dangerous among them to be knowne for one that was lerned, and more dangerous, if any
men were found with a penner and inkhorne at his side: for such seldome or neuer
escaped from them with life.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The capteine once slaine the soldiers faint.</p>

<p>An armie of fortie thousand horssemen.</p>

<p>The Kentishmen eftsoones rebell.</p></div>

<p>But to returne to saie somewhat more concerning the end of their rebellious enterprises,
you must vnderstand, how after that Wat Tiler was slaine at London in the presence of
the king (as before ye haue heard) the hope and confidence of the rebels greatlie decaied:
and yet neuerthelesse, the king and his councell being not well assured, granted to the
commons (as ye haue heard) charters of manumission and infranchisement from all <span class="xxpn" id="p747">|747|</span>
bondage, and so sent them awaie home to their countries: and foorthwith herevpon he assembled
an armie of the Londoners, and of all others in the countries abroad that bare
him good will, appointing none to come, but such as were armed and had horsses, for he
would haue no footmen with him.
Thus it came to passe, that within thrée daies he had
about him fourtie thousand horssemen, as was estéemed;
so that in England had not béene
heard of the like armie assembled togither at one time. And herewith was the king aduertised,
that the Kentishmen began eftsoones to stir, wherewith the king and the whole
armie were so grieuouslie offended, that they meant streight to haue set vpon that countrie,
and to haue wholie destroied that rebellious generation. But thorough intercession
made by the lords and gentlemen of that countrie, the king pacified his mood, and so
resolued to procéed against them by order of law and iustice, causing iudges to sit and
to make inquisition of the malefactors, and especiallie of such as were authors of the
mischéefes.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Iack Straw and his adherents executed.</p></div>

<p>And about the same time did the maior of London sit in iudgement, as well vpon the
offendors that were citizens, as of other that were of Kent, Essex, Southsex, Norffolke,
Suffolke, and other counties, being found within the liberties of the citie; and such as
were found culpable, he caused them to lose their heads, as Iacke Straw, Iohn Kirkbie,
Alane Tredera, and Iohn Sterling, that gloried of himselfe, for that he was the man that
had slaine the archbishop. This fellow (as it is written by some authors) streight waies
after he had doone that wicked deed, fell out of his wits, and comming home into Essex
where he dwelt, tied a naked sword about his necke, that hoong downe before on his brest,
and likewise a dagger naked, that hanged downe behind on his backe, and so went vp and
downe the lanes &amp; stréets about home, crieng out, and protesting, that with those weapons
he had dispatched the archbishop; and after he had remained a while at home, he came
to London againe, for that he shuld receiue (as he said) the reward there of the act which
he had committed: and so indéed, when he came thither, and boldlie confessed that he
was the man that had beheaded the archbishop, he lost his head in steed of a recompense:
and diuerse other both of Essex and Kent, that had laid violent hands vpon the archbishop
came to the like end at London, where they did the deed, being bewraied by their owne
confessions.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The maior and fiue aldermen knighted.</p>

<p>The armes of London augmented by additiō of the dagger.</p></div>

<p>Here is to be remembred, that the king, after the citie of London was deliuered from
the danger of the rebels (as before ye haue heard) in respect of the great manhood, and
assured loialtie which had appeared in the maior, and other of the aldermen, for some part
of recompense of their faithfull assistance in that dangerous season, made the said maior
William Walworth knight, with fiue other aldermen his brethren, to wit, Nicholas Bramble,
Iohn Philpot, Nicholas Twiford, Robert Laundre, and Robert Gaiton, also Iohn
Standish, that (as ye haue heard) holpe to slaie Wat Tiler. Moreouer, the king granted,
that there should be a dagger added to the armes of the citie of London, in the right
quarter of the shield, for an augmentation of the same armes, and for a remembrance of
this maior his valiant act, as dooth appeare vnto this daie; for till that time, the citie bare
onelie the crosse, without the dagger.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The cōmons of Essex rebell afresh.</p>

<p>The rebels of Essex are scattered &amp; slaine.</p></div>

<p>Although the kings authoritie thus began to shew it selfe, to the terror of rebels; yet
the commons of Essex eftsoones assembled themselues togither, not far from Hatfield
Peuerell, and sent to the king to know of him if his pleasure was, that they should inioy
their promised liberties: and further, that they might be as frée as their lords, and not
to come to any court, except it were to the great léet, twise in the yeare. When the king
heard such presumptuous requests, he was in a great chafe, &amp; dispatched the messengers
awaie, with a sore threatning answer, saieng that bondmen they were, and bondmen they
should be, and that in more vile manner than before, to the terrible example of all other
that should attempt any the like disorders:
and foorthwith, the earle of Buckingham, and
the lord Thomas Percie, brother to the earle of North­um­ber­land, were sent with an armie
to represse those rebels, whome they found fortified within woods, hedges and ditches <span class="xxpn" id="p748">|748|</span>
verie stronglie, but with small adoo they were put to flight, &amp; about fiue hundred of
them slaine; the residue saued themselues as well as they might, by succour of the woods.
There were eight hundred horsses also taken, which those rebels had there with them, to
draw and carrie their baggage.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Those of the rebels that escaped, were not yet so tamed by that ouerthrow, but that
assembling themselues togither in a rowt, they made towards Colchester: and comming
thither, would haue persuaded the townesmen to haue ioined with them in a new rebellion.
But when they could not bring their purpose to passe they marched towards Sudburie.
The lord Fitz Walter, and sir Iohn Harleston, vnderstanding which waie they
tooke, followed them with a companie of armed men, and suddenlie setting vpon them as
they were making their proclamations, slue of them so manie as it liked them, and the
other they saued, and suffered to depart, or else committed them to prison. After this,
the king came to Hauering at the bowre, and from thence to Chelmisford, where he appointed
sir Robert Trisilian to sit in iudgement of the offendors and rebels of that countrie,
wherevpon an inquest being chosen, a great number were indited, arreigned, &amp; found
giltie, so that vpon some one gallowes there were nine or ten hanged togither.</p>

<p>In euerie countrie were like inquiries made, and the chéefe offendors apprehended and
put to death in euerie lordship through the realme, where anie of them were detected, by
ten, twelue, twentie, thirtie, yea and in some places by fortie at once; so that the whole
number grew to fifteene hundred and aboue. At the first, when the kings iustices began
to sit in Essex, Kent, and at London, by reason of the multitude that were to be executed,
they onelie chopped off their heads, but afterwards when that kind of death seemed too
close and secret for so open offenses, they proceeded according to the accustomed law of
the realme, by condemning them to be drawne and hanged, and according thervnto they
were executed.
In the meane time, the king by the aduise of his councell, directed his
letters reuocatorie into euerie countie there, to be proclaimed in euerie citie, borrow,
towne, and place, as well within the liberties as without; by the which letters he reuoked,
made void and frustrate his former letters of infranchising the bondmen of his realme, and
commanded that such as had the same letters, should without delaie bring them in, and
restore them to him and his councell to be cancelled, as they would answer vpon their faith
and allegiance which they owght to him, and vpon paine of forfeiting all that they had.
The date of which letters reuocatorie was at Chelmesford, the second daie of Iulie, in the

<p>When the king had quieted the countie of Essex, and punished such as were the chéefe

doone vpon such as had demeaned themselues most pre­sump­tu­ous­lie against the kings

vnder a colour of fréendship, that they trusted to find in some persons about the
king. But that trust deceiued them, and procured the more displeasure against them, for
that they would not sue for fauour at the abbats hands in time, by submitting themselues
vnto his will and pleasure. To be breefe, the king came thither with a great number of
armed men and archers, and caused his iustice sir Robert Trisilian to sit in iudgement

kings presence, wherevpon he was arreigned and condemned, to be drawne, hanged, and
headed for such notable treasons as he was there conuicted of. He receiued iudgement
vpon the saturdaie the first daie that the said sir Robert Trisilian sat in iudgement, but he
was not executed till the mondaie following. This man had beene a preacher the space of
twentie yeares, and bicause his doctrine was not according to the religion then by the
bishops mainteined, he was first prohibited to preach in anie church or chappell; and when
he ceassed not for all that, but set foorth his doctrine in the streets &amp; fields where he might <span class="xxpn" id="p749">|749|</span>

at length he was committed to prison, out of the which he prophesied that

</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">and
so continuing his sermon, went about to prooue by the words of that prouerbe, that
from the beginning, all men by nature were created alike, and that bondage or seruitude
came in by iniust oppression of naughtie men. For if God would haue had anie bondmen
from the beginning, he would haue appointed who should be bond &amp; who free. And
therefore he exhorted them to consider, that now the time was come appointed to them
by God, in which they might (if they would) cast off the yoke of bondage, &amp; recouer
libertie. He counselled them therefore to remember themselues, and to take good hearts
vnto them, that after the manner of a good husband that tilleth his ground, and riddeth
out thereof such euill wéeds as choke and destroie the good corne, they might destroie
first the great lords of the realme, and after the iudges and lawiers, questmoongers, and all
other whom they vndertooke to be against the commons, for so might they procure peace
and suertie to themselues in time to come, if dispatching out of the waie the great men,
there should be an equalitie in libertie, no difference in degrées of nobilitie, but a like dignitie
and equall authoritie in all things brought in among them.</p>

<p>When he had preached and set foorth such kind of doctrine, and other the like fond
and foolish toies vnto the people, they extolled him to the starres, affirming that he ought
to be archbishop and lord chancellour, where he that then enioied that roome, meaning
sir Simon de Sudburie that then was aliue, was a traitor to the king and realme, and
worthie to lose his head, wheresoeuer he might be apprehended. Manie other things are

Walter Saunford, Richard Gifford, Thomas Eidon, and William Eccleshall, commanding
them to cause proclamation to be made in all such townes and places as were thought
necessarie, through the whole countries of Buckingham and Hertford, that all and euerie
person and persons that ought and had beene accustomed to doo or yeeld anie manner of

in such like forme &amp; manner, as they had beene vsed to doo, before the time of the late

vpon paine to forfeit all that they might forfeit: and in case anie were found to doo contrarie

<p>The commōs of Hertfordshire sworne to the king.</p></div>

<p>On saint Margarets daie, the king being readie to take his iournie to Berkhamstéed, in
the great court of the abbeie of S. Albons had all the commons of the countie of Hertford
before him, that had summons there to appeare, all that were betwixt fiftéene and thréescore
yéeres of age, where they tooke an oth togither from thencefoorth, to be faithfull
subiects vnto him, and neuer to rise or make anie commotion, to the disturbance of his
peace; and rather to die, than to consent vnto anie rebellious persons, whome they should
to the vttermost of their powers do their best, to apprehend and deliuer them to the kings
prison, that they might be foorth comming. After they had receiued this oth, they were
licenced to depart, and the king rode to Berkhamsteed, where he remained for a time,
and went to Esthamstéed to recreate himselfe with hunting, where he was informed, that
those which were hanged at S. Albons, were taken from the gallowes, and remooued a good
waie from the same: with which presumption he was so stirred, that he sent foorthwith
his letters to the bailiffes of the towne of S. Albons, commanding them vpon the sight of
the same, to cause cheines to be made, and to bring the said bodies backe vnto the gallowes,
and to hang them in those chaines vpon the same gallowes, there to remaine, so
long as one peece might sticke to another, according to the forme of the iudgement giuen.
The test of this writ thus directed to the bailiffes of saint Albons, was at Esthamstéed the
third of August, in the fift yeare of this kings reigne, and in the yeare of our lord a thousand
three hundred foure score and one.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The townesmen of S. Albons durst not disobeie the kings commandement, and so hanged
vp againe in chaines the dead bodies of their neighbors, greatlie to their shame and reproch,
when they could get none other for anie wages to come néere the stinking carcasses,
but that they were constreined themselues to take in hand so vile an office. And such
was the end of the tumults at S. Albons, where as well as in other places, the vnrulie
commons had plaied their parts. To conclude and make an end of these diuelish troubles,
to the end it may appeare, in what danger as well the K. as the whole state of the
realme stood, by the mischéefous attempts of the vnrulie people, I haue thought good to
declare the confession of Iacke Straw one of their chéefe capteins (and next in reputation <span class="xxpn" id="p751">|751|</span>
amongst them vnto Wat Tiler) when he came to be executed in London, according to
iudiciall sentence passed against him.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The confession of Iacke Straw at the time of his death.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ “At</span>
the same time (said he) that we were assembled vpon Blackeheath, and had sent
to the king to come vnto vs, our purpose was to haue slaine all such knights, esquiers, and
gentlemen, as should haue giuen their attendance thither vpon him: and as for the king,
we would haue kept him amongst vs, to the end that the people might more boldlie haue
repaired to vs, sith they should haue thought, that whatsoeuer we did, the same had béene
doone by his authoritie. Finally, when we had gotten power inough, that we needed not
to feare anie force that might be made against vs, we would haue slaine all such noble
men, as might either haue giuen counsell, or made anie resistance against vs, speciallie the
knights of the Rhodes; and lastlie we would haue killed the king and all men of possessions,
with bishops, moonks, chanons, and parsons of churches, onelie friers Mendicants
we would haue spared, that might haue sufficed for ministration of the sacraments. And
when we had made a riddance of all those, we would haue deuised lawes, according to the
which the subiects of this realme should haue liued, for we would haue created kings, as
Wat Tiler in Kent, and other in other countries. But bicause this our purpose was disappointed
by the archbishop of Canturburie, that would not permit the king to come to vs,
we sought by all meanes to dispatch him out of the waie, as at length we did. Morouer,
the same euening that Wat Tiler was killed, we were determined, hauing the greatest part
of the commons of the citie bent to ioine with vs, to haue set fire in foure corners of the
citie, and so to haue diuided amongst vs the spoile of the cheefest riches that might haue
beene found at our pleasure. And this (said he) was our purpose, as God may helpe me
now at my last end.”<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Thus you may see, after what sort they were conspired to the destruction of the realme,
and to haue aduanced and inriched themselues; not considering or foreséeing the euill
successe of their tumultuous broile, and that it would tend but little to their profit
in the end, by a common spoile to amend their state, and to become mightie and rich
with goods euill gotten, which though for a time (if lucke had serued them to haue
possessed) they had enioied, yet could they not long prosper nor bring good vnto the possessors:

<p>And lest this one mans confession might séeme insufficient, diuerse other of them confessed
the same, or much what the like in effect, when they saw no remedie but present
death before their eies. To declare the occasion whie such mischeefes happened thus in
the realme, we leaue to the iudgement of those that may coniecture a truth thereof, by
conferring the manners of that age &amp; behauiour of all states then, sith they that wrote in

But truelie it is to be thought, that the faults, as well in one degrée as an
other, speciallie the sinnes of the whole nation, procured such vengeance to rise, whereby
they might be warned of their euill dooings, and séeke to reforme the same in time conuenient.
But as it commeth still to passe, when the danger is once ouershot, repentance
likewise is put ouer, and is no more regarded, till an other scourge commeth eftsoones to

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The capteine of Berwike will not suffer the duke

<p>It this meane time that these troubles were at the hottest in England, the duke of Lancaster
being in Scotland, so behaued himselfe (in the treatie which he had in hand with
the Scots) dissembling the matter so, as if he had not vnderstood of any trouble in England
at all, that finallie before the Scots had knowledge thereof, a truce was concluded to
indure for two yeares, or (as other haue) for three yeares.
When he had made an end
there, and that all things were agréed vpon and passed, for the confirmation of that accord,
he returned to Berwike, but at his comming thither, the capteine sir Matthew Redman
would not suffer him to enter the towne, bicause of a commandement giuen to him <span class="xxpn" id="p752">|752|</span>
from the earle of North­um­ber­land, lord warden of the marches: wherefore the duke was
glad to returne into Scotland againe, obteining licence of the Scots to remaine amongst
them, till the realme of England was reduced to better quiet. Hervpon, the commons
in England that fauored him not, tooke occasion to report the worst of him that might be
deuised, calling him now in time of their rebellious commotions, a traitor to the realme,
declaring that he had ioined himselfe to the Scots, and meant to take part with them
against his owne natiue countrie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The king indéed had sent commandement, during the time of the rebellious troubles,
vnto the earle of North­um­ber­land, that he should haue good regard to the safe keeping
of all the townes &amp; castels vnder his rule, &amp; not to suffer any person to enter the same,
hauing forgotten to except the duke of Lancaster being then in Scotland: whervpon the
duke tooke no small displeasure with the earle of North­um­ber­land, as after he well shewed
at his comming home. But before he returned foorth of Scotland, he wrote to the king
to vnderstand his plesure, in what sort he should returne, humbling himselfe in such
wise, as he made offer to come with one knight, one esquier, and a groome, if it should
please the king so to appoint him; or if it so were that by his presence it was thought the
realme was like to fall in any trouble, he was readie to depart into exile, neuer to returne
into his countrie againe, if so be that through his absence the king and realme might inioy
peace and quietnesse.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The duke of Lancaster chargeth the earle of North­um­ber­land

<p>The king hearing such offers, wrote to him, that his pleasure was to haue him to returne
home, with all his whole traine; and if the same were not thought sufficient to
gard him, he should take of euerie towne by the which he passed, a certeine number of
men to attend him vnto the next towne for his safegard, and so it was doone, the king
sending him commission to that effect, and thus comming to the court, he was of the king
right honorablie receiued. Within few daies after his comming, he exhibited a grieuous
complaint against the earle of North­um­ber­land, for abusing him in diuerse sorts, in time
of the late troubles, so as his honour was greatlie thereby touched, for which the earle
was sent for, and commanded to come vnto Berkhamstéed, where all the lords in maner
of the land were assembled in councell.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Here, after the duke had laid diuerse things to the earles charge, for his disobedience,
vnfaithfulnesse, and ingratitude; the earle after the manner of his countrie, not able to
forbeare, breake out into reprochfull words against the duke, although he was commanded
by the king to cease, where the duke kept silence in humble maner, at the first
word, when the K. commanded him to hold his peace, so that by reason of the earles disobedience
in that behalfe, he was arrested.
But yet the earls of Warwike and Suffolke
vndertaking for his appearance at the next parlement, he was suffered to depart, and so
the councell brake vp.
About the feast of All saints the parlement began, to the which
the duke of Lancaster came bringing with him an excéeding number of armed men, and
likewise the earle of North­um­ber­land with no lesse companie came likewise to London, &amp;
was lodged within the citie, hauing great friendship shewed towards him of the citizens, who
promised to assist him at all times, when necessitie required, so that his part séemed
to be ouerstrong for the duke, if they should haue come to anie trial of their forces at
that time.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The Duke laie with his people in the suburbs, and euerie daie when they went to the
parlement house at Westminster, both parts went thither in armour, to the great terror
of those that were wise and graue personages, fearing some mischiefe to fall foorth of
that vnaccustomed manner of their going armed to the parlement house, contrarie to the
ancient vsage of the realme.
At length, to quiet the parties and to auoid such in­con­uen­i­en­ces,
as might haue growen of their dissention, the king tooke the matter into his
hands, and so they were made fréends, to the end that some good might be doone in that
parlement, for reformation of things touching the state of the realme, for which cause it
was especiallie called: but now after it had continued a long time, and few things at all <span class="xxpn" id="p753">|753|</span>
concluded, newes came that the ladie Anne sister to the emperour Wenslaus, &amp; affianced
wife to the king of England, was come to Calis, whervpon the parliament was proroged
till after Christmas, that in the meane time the marriage might be solemnized, which was
appointed after the Epiphanie: and foorthwith great preparation was made to receiue the
bride, that she might be conueied with all honor vnto the kings

<p>Such as should receiue hir at Douer repaired thither, where at hir landing, a maruellous
and right strange woonder happened; for she was no sooner out of hir ship, and got
to land in safetie with all hir companie, but that foorthwith the water was so troubled and
shaken, as the like thing had not to any mans remembrance euer béene heard of: so that
the ship in which the appointed queene came ouer, was terriblie rent in péeces, and the
residue so beaten one against an other, that they were scattered here and there after a
woonderful manner.
Before hir comming to the citie of London, she was met on Blackheath
by the maior and citizens of London in most honorable wise, and so with great
triumph conueied to Westminster, where (at the time appointed) all the nobilitie of the
realme being assembled, she was ioined in marriage to the king, and crowned quéene by
the archbishop of Canturburie, with all the glorie and honor that might be deuised. There
were also holden for the more honour of the said marriage, solemne iustes for certeine
daies togither, in which, as well the Englishmen as the new quéenes countriemen shewed
proofe of their manhood and valiancie, whereby praise &amp; commendation of knightlie
prowesse was atchiued, not without damage of both the parties.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>After that the solemnitie of the marriage was finished, the parlement eftsoones began,
in the which many things were inacted, for the behoofe of the commonwealth. And
amongst other things it was ordeined, that all maner manumissions, obligations, releasses,
and other bonds made by compulsion, dures, and menace, in time of this last
tumult and riot against the lawes of the land, and good faith, should be vtterlie void
and adnihilated. And further, that if the kings faithful liege people did perceiue any
gathering of the cōmons in suspected wise, to the number of six or seuen, holding conuenticles
togither, they should not staie for the kings writ in that behalfe for their warrant,
but foorthwith it should be lawfull for them to apprehend such people, assembling
togither, and to laie them in prison, till they might answer their dooings. These and
manie other things were established in this parlement, of the which, the most part were set

quiet, by his noble and prudent gouernement. In this season, Wicliffe set forth diuerse
articles and conclusions of his doctrine, which the new archbishop of Canturburie, William
Courtneie, latelie remooued from the sée of London, vnto the higher dignitie, did
what he could by all shifts to suppresse, and to force such as were the setters foorth and
mainteiners thereof, to recant, and vtterlie to renounce. What he brought to passe, in

The tuesday next after the feast of saint Iohn Port latine, an other parlement began, in

richlie laden with wine, wax, and other good merchandize. This yeare the maior of
London Iohn de Northampton, otherwise called Iohn de Comberton, did punish such
as were taken in adulterie, verie extremelie: for first he put them in the prison, called
the tunne, that then stood in Cornehill, and after caused the women to haue their haire
cut, as théeues in those daies were serued that were appeachers of others, and so were
they led about the stréets with trumpets &amp; pipes going before them. Neither were the
men spared more than the women, being put to manie open shames and reproches. But
bicause the punishment of such offenses was thought rather to apperteine vnto the spirituall

sealed therewith such grants and writings as it pleased him: at length, it was deliuered to
Robert Braibrooke bishop of London, who was made lord chancellor. The cause why
the lord Scroope was remooued from that dignitie, was this. When the king vpon certeine
respects had granted certeine gentlemen the lands and possessions that belonged to
the late earle of March, and other that were deceassed (which he, during the time of their
heires minorities, ought to inioy by the lawes of the realme) the said lord chancellor refused
to seale such grants, alledging that the king being greatlie in debt, which he was
to discharge, stood in need of such profits himselfe, and therefore (as he said) he tooke
not them for faithfull seruants, nor dutifull subiects to his grace, that respecting their
owne priuat commoditie more than his or the realmes, did sue for such grants at his
hands, aduising them to hold themselues contented with such other things, as it had
pleased or might please the king to bestow vpon them: for suerlie he would not consent,
that they should inioy such gifts as those were. They that were thus reiected, made their
complaint in such sort to the king, that he taking displeasure with the said lord Scroope,
deposed him from his office, to the great offense both of the nobles and commons, by

that from thencefoorth, none of that companie, nor anie of the
vinteners, butchers, grossers, or other that sold anie prouision of vittels, should be admitted
maior of the citie; and so by this shift they sought to cut off all meanes from the
fishmongers to recouer againe their old former degrée. And bicause it was knowne well
inough of what authoritie sir Iohn Philpot knight was within the citie, and that he fauoured
those whome the lord maior the said Iohn de Northampton fauoured not, he was
put off from the bench, and might not sit with them that were of the secret councell in
the cities affaires, whereas neuerthelesse he had trauelled more for the preseruation of
the cities liberties than all the residue. Sir Henrie Spenser bishop of Norwich, receiued <span class="xxpn" id="p756">|756|</span>
buls a little before this present from pope Vrbane, to signe all such with the crosse, that
would take vpon them to go ouer the seas with him, to warre against those that held with
the antipape Clement,
that tooke himselfe for pope, and to such as would receiue the
crosse in that quarrell, such like beneficiall pardons were granted by pope Vrbane, as
were accustomablie granted vnto such as went to fight against the Infidels, Turkes, and
Saracens, to wit free remission of sinnes, and manie other graces. The bishop of Norwich
that had the disposing of the benefits granted by those buls, to all such as either
would go themselues in person, or else giue anie thing toward the furtherance of that
voiage, &amp; maintenance of them that went in the same, shewed those buls in open parlement,
&amp; caused copies to be written forth, &amp; sent into euerie quarter, that his authoritie
&amp; power legantine might be notified to all men, for the better bringing to passe of
that he had in charge. And truelie it should appeare, there wanted no diligence in the
man to accomplish the popes purpose: and on the other part yée must note, that the priuileges
which he had from the pope, were passing large, so that as the matter was handled,
there were diuerse lords, knights, esquires, and other men of warre in good numbers,
that offered themselues to go in that voiage, and to follow the standards of the
church with the bishop, and no small summes of monie were leuied and gathered amongst
the people, for the furnishing foorth of that armie, as after yée shall heare.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

it so patientlie as he might, and returned home with his people, sore offended (though
he said little) against the king of Portingale, for that he dealt otherwise in this matter

<p>In the Lent season of this sixt yeare of king Richards reigne, an other parlement was
called at London, in the which there was hard hold about the buls sent to the bishop of
Norwich from pope Vrbane, concerning his iournie that he should take in hand against
the Clementines (as we may call them, for that they held with pope Clement) whome
the Vrbanists (that is, such as held with pope Vrbane) tooke for schismatikes. Diuerse
there were, that thought it not good that such summes of monie shuld be leuied of the
kings subiects, and the same togither with an armie of men to be committed vnto the
guiding of a prelat vnskilfull in warlike affaires. Other there were that would needs
haue him to go, that the enimies of the church (as they tooke them) might be subdued.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>And although the more part of the lords of the vpper house, and likewise the knights
and burgesses of the lower house were earnestlie bent against this iournie; yet at length
those that were of the contrarie mind, preuailed; &amp; so it was decreed, that it should forward,
and that the said bishop of Norwich should haue the fiftéenth granted to the king
in the last parlement, to paie the wages of such men of warre as should go ouer with him;
for soldiers without monie passed not much of par dons,
nonot in those daies, except at <span class="xxpn" id="p757">|757|</span>
the verie point of death, if they were not assured how to be answered of their wages, or
of some other con­si­der­a­tion wherby they might gaine.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ The</span> tenth that was granted afore
by the bishops at Oxford, was now in this same parlement appointed to remaine to the

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The crossed souldiers.</p></div>

<p>These things being thus appointed, the bishop sent foorth his letters firmed with his
seale into euerie prouince and countrie of this land, giuing to all parsons, vicars, and
curats, through this realme, power and authoritie to heare the confessions of their parishioners,
and to grant vnto those that would bestow any parcell of their goods,
which
God had lent them towards the aduancing of the iournie to be made by the crossed souldiers
against pope Vrbans enimies, the absolution and remission of all their sinnes by the
popes authoritie, according to the forme of the bull before mentioned. The people vnderstanding
of so great and gratious a benefit (as they tooke it) thus offered to the English
nation, at home in their owne houses, were desirous to be partakers thereof, and
those that were warlike men, prepared themselues to go foorth in that iournie with all
spéed possible. The residue that were not fit to be warriors, according to that they were
exhorted by their confessors, bestowed liberallie of their goods to the furtherance of those
that went: and so, few there were within the whole kingdome, but that either they went,
or gaue somewhat to the aduancing foorth of the bishop of Norwich his voiage.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>This bishop chose diuerse to be associat with him, as capteins that were expert in warlike
enterprises. The first and principall was sir Hugh Caluerlie an old man of warre,
and one that in all places had borne himselfe both valiantlie and politikelie; next vnto
him was sir William Farington, who stoutlie spake in the bishops cause, when the matter
came in question in the parlement house, touching his going ouer with his croisie. Besides
these, there went diuerse noble men and knights of high renowme, as the lord Henrie
Beaumount,
sir William Elmham, and sir Thomas Triuet, sir Iohn Ferrers, sir Hugh
Spenser the bishops nephue by his brother, sir Matthew Redman capteine of Berwike,
sir Nicholas Tarenson or Traicton, sir William Farington, and manie other of the English

de Chasteauneuf, Raimund de Marsen, Guillonet de Paux, Gariot Vighier, Iohn de
Cachitan, and diuerse other. Sir Iohn Beauchampe was appointed marshall of the
field, but bicause he was at that present in the marches of the realme towards Scotland,
he was not readie to passe ouer when the bishop did. The duke of Lancaster liked not
well of the bishops iournie, for that he saw how his voiage that he meant to make into
Spaine was hereby for the time disappointed, and he could haue béene better contented
(as appeareth by writers) to haue had the monie imploied vpon the warres against the
king of Castile that was a Clementine, than to haue it bestowed vpon this voiage, which
the bishop was to take in hand against the French king, and other in these néerer parts.

find, that the fishmongers, which through meanes of the late lord maior Iohn of Northampton
and his complices were put from their ancient customes and liberties, which they
inioied aforetime within the citie, were now restored to the same againe, sauing that they
might not kéepe courts among themselues, as in times past they vsed, but that after the

and customes by them committed, should be heard, tried, and reformed in the maiors

<p>When the bishop therefore had set things in good forwardnesse for his iournie, he drew
towards the sea side, and was so desirous to passe ouer, and to inuade his aduersaries, <span class="xxpn" id="p758">|758|</span>
that although the king sent to him an expresse commandement by letters to returne to the
court, that he might conferre with him before he tooke the seas; yet excusing himselfe,
that the time would not then permit him to staie longer, he passed ouer to Calis, where
he landed the 23 of Aprill, in this sixt yeare of king Richards reigne.
The armie to attend
him in this iournie, rose to the number of two thousand horssemen, and fifteene
thousand footmen (as some write) though other speake of a far lesser number. But it
should seeme that they went not ouer all at one time, but by parts, as some before the
bishop, some with him, and some after him.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The earle of Flāders sendeth to the bishop of Norwich to

<p>Now when he and the capteins before named, were come ouer to Calis, they tooke
counsell togither into what place they should make their first inuasion; and bicause their
commission was to make warre onelie against those that held with pope Clement, the more
part were of this mind, that it should be most expedient for them to enter into France, and
to make warre against the Frenchmen, whom all men knew to be chiefe mainteiners of the
said Clement.
But the bishop of Norwich was of this opinion, that they could not doo better
than to inuade the countrie of Flanders, bicause that a litle before, earle Lewes hauing intelligence
that king Richard had made a confederacie with them of Gaunt, had on the
other part expelled all Englishmen out of his dominions and countries, so that the merchants
which had their goods at Bruges, and other places in Flanders, susteined great
losses. Howbeit there were that replied against the bishops purpose herein, as sir Hugh
Caluerlie and others; yet at length they yeelded thereto, and so by his commandement
they went streight to Grauelin, the 21 day of Maie, and immediatlie wan it by assault.
Wherevpon Bruckburge was yeelded vnto them, the liues and goods of them within
saued. Then went they to Dunkirke, &amp; without any great resistance entred the towne,
and wan there excéeding much by the spoile, for it was full of riches, which the Englishmen
pilfered at their pleasure.
The earle of Flanders lieng at Lisle was aduertised how
the Englishmen were thus entered his countrie, wherevpon he sent ambassadors vnto the
English host, to vnderstand why they made him warre that was a right Vrbanist.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The bishop of Norwich for answer, declared to them that were sent, that he tooke the
countrie to apperteine to the French king, as he that had of late conquered it, whom all
the whole world knew to be a Clementine, or at the least he was assured that the countrie
thereabouts was of the inheritance of the ladie of Bar, which likewise was a Clementine:
and therefore, except the people of that countrie would come and ioine with him to go
against such as were knowne to be enimies to pope Vrbane, he would suerlie séeke to
destroie them. And whereas the earls ambassadors required safe conduct to go into
England by Calis, to vnderstand the kings pleasure in this mater, the bishop would grant
them none at all; wherefore they went backe againe to the earle their maister with that
answer.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The Englishmen after the taking and spoiling of Dunkirke, returned to Grauelin and
Bruckburge, which places they fortified, and then leauing garrisons in them, they went
to Mardike, and tooke it, for it was not closed.
In the meane time, the countriemen of
west Flanders rose in armour, and came, to Dunkirke, meaning to resist the Englishmen:
whereof when the bishop was certified, with all speed he marched thither, and comming
to the place where the Flemings, to the number of more than twelue thousand were ranged
without the towne, he sent an herald vnto them to know the truth, of whether pope they
held; but the rude people, not vnderstanding what apperteined to the law of armes,
ran vpon the herald at his approching to them, and slue him before he could begin to tell

<p>The Englishmen herewith inflamed, determined either to reuenge the death of their

aboue five thousand fighting men in all, the bishop placed himselfe amongst the horssemen,
and set the footmen in a battell marshalled wedgewise, broad behind and sharpe
before, hauing with them a banner wherein the crosse was beaten. The archers were <span class="xxpn" id="p759">|759|</span>
ranged on either side: the standard of the church went before, the field gules, and two
keies siluer, signifieng that they were souldiors of pope Vrbane. Moreouer, the bishop
had his penon there siluer and azure quarterlie, a freat gold on the azure, a bend gules
on the siluer; and bicause he was yoongest of the Spensers, he bare a border gules for a
difference. At the approching of the battels togither the trumpets blew vp, and the
archers began to shoot against the battell of the Flemings, the which valiantlie defended
themselues, &amp; fought egerlie a long time, but at length they were so galled with arrowes
which the archers shot at them a flanke, that they were not able to indure, but were compelled
to giue backe.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>They were diuided into two battels, a vaward, and a rereward. When the vaward
began to shrinke, the rereward also brake order, and fled, but the Englishmen pursued
them so fast, that they could not escape, but were ouertaken and slaine in great numbers.
Some saie, there died of them in the battell and chase fiue thousand, some six thousand;
and others write, that there were nine thousand of them slaine: and Thomas Walsingham
affirmeth twelue thousand. Manie of them fled into the towne of Dunkirke for succour,
but the Englishmen pursued them so egerlie, that they entered the towne with them, and
slue them downe in the streets.
The Flemings in diuerse places gathered themselues
togither againe as they fled, and shewed countenance of defense, but still they were
driuen out of order, and brought to confusion. The préests and religious men that
were with the bishop fought most egerlie, some one of them slaieng sixtéene of the

<p>There died of Englishmen at this battell about foure hundred. The Flemings had no
horssemen amongst them, nor anie number of gentlemen, for they stood in such dread of
English bowes, that they durst not come to anie battell with them, but kéeping themselues
out of danger, set the commons of the countrie in hand to trie what they against the Englishmen
were able to doo without them. This battell was fought vpon a mondaie being
the fifteenth of Maie. The countrie was put in a woonderfull feare by this ouerthrow,
so that the townes and fortresses were in great doubt, and some yeelded themselues to
the Englishmen, as Berghen and others; some were woone by force, as the castell of
Drinchan, and the towne of S. Venant.
To be short, the Englishmen became maisters of
all the countrie alongst the sea side, euen from Grauelin to Sluis, and got such riches by
pillage and spoile, as they could not wish for greater. They preuailed so much, that
they wan in maner all the close towns within the bailiffeweekes of Cassell, of Popering,
Messines, and Furneis, with the townes of Newport, Blankberke, and diuerse other.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

into those woods for feare of the enemies: but the Englishmen, plaieng the part of good
bloudhounds, found them out, &amp; sent all their booties and preie vnto Grauelin and
Bruckburge.
On the eight daie of Iune they came before the towne of Ypres, and laid
siege thereto, whereat they continued the space of nine wéekes. Thither came to their
aid twentie thousand Gauntiners vnder the leading of Francis Akreman, Peter Wood,
and Peter Winter: so that they within Ypres were streictlie besieged, but there were
within it in garrison diuerse valiant knights &amp; capteins, which defended the towne right
manfullie:
it was fensed with a mightie rampire, and a thicke hedge, trimlie plashed

<p>During the time that the siege laie before Ypres, the Englishmen swarmed abroad in

ouer had found, there came dailie foorth of England great numbers to be partakers of
the gaine. Sir Iohn Philpot that fauoured the bishops iournie, prouided them of vessels
for their passage, till the bishop vnderstanding that the more part of those that came thus
ouer were vnarmed, and brought nothing with them from home, but onelie swords, bowes <span class="xxpn" id="p760">|760|</span>
and arrowes, did write vnto the said sir Iohn Philpot, that he should suffer none to passe
the seas, but such as were men able and likelie to doo seruice: where a great number of
those that were come to him, were fit for nothing but to consume vittels, much like

<p>The multitude of Englishmen and Gauntiners at this siege was great, so that diuerse
skirmishes chanced betwixt them, and such as were appointed by the earle to lie in garrisons
against them:
but still the victorie abode on the English side. Also there was an
English préest, one sir Iohn Boring that went to Gaunt with fiue hundred English archers,
by whose aid Arnold Hans one of the capteins of Gaunt ouercame his enimies in
battell, which were laid in a castell neere to the hauen of Allost, and stopped that no
vittels might safelie come out of Holland or Zeland to be conueied to Gaunt.
The earle
of Flanders was not well contented in his mind, that the Englishmen were thus entred
into his countrie, and therefore earnestlie laboured to the duke of Burgognie (that had
married his daughter, and should be heire of all his dominions and seigniories after his

<p>The duke, whome the matter touched so néere, did so much with his nephew the

Flanders, so that the Englishmen perceiuing themselues not of power to incounter with
this huge and mightie armie, were constreined after a great assault, which they gaue the
eight of August, to raise their siege from Ypres the mondaie after, being S. Laurence
daie, and to withdraw into Bruckburge, Berghen, Dixmew, Newport, Cassell, Dunkirke,
Grauelin, and other places which they had woon. But at Newport the townesmen
set vp the earles banner, and assailing those that were come into the towne, slue diuerse
of them. The Englishmen being sore offended therewith, came running thither with
certeine Gauntiners, and made great slaughter of them that had so murthered their fellowes.
The towne was sacked, and all the goods aswell church iewels as other were sent
awaie, partlie by sea into England, and partlie by waggons vnto Berge. After this, they
set fire in more than thirtie places of the towne, so that there remained nothing vnburnt.
The Englishmen &amp; Gauntiners that were withdrawne into Berge, got togither all the waggons

into Picardie, and there to haue offered the French king battell, before his whole puissance
had beene assembled: but sir Thomas Triuet and sir William Elmham with other,
would in no wise consent therevnto, so that the bishop taking with him sir Hugh Caluerlie,
that did neuer forsake him, bad the other farewell; and first making a road into
Picardie, he after withdrew into Grauelin, whiles the other went to Bruckburge. But by
Froissard, and other writers it appeareth, that sir Hugh was certeinlie at Berge, with other
that were retired thither, in purpose to defend it against the French king, who still followed
them, and recouered diuerse places out of their hands by force, as Mont Cassell,
the castell of Crincham, and other. Also at his comming to Berghen, the said sir Hugh
Caluerlie, and other that were within it, perceiuing that they were not able to defend it
against such a puissance as the French king had there with him, being greater than euer
sir Hugh Caluerlie that ancient capteine wold haue thought that France had béene able
to haue set foorth, departed, and left the towne to be spoiled of the Britons, and other
French souldiers, which executed there all kinds of crueltie. The more part of the Englishmen
went to Bruckburge, but sir Hugh Caluerlie went to Grauelin, and so to Calis,
as one sore displeased in his mind, for that his counsell could not be regarded in all this

came thither, and fortified it for a countergarison to Calis.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ There</span> be that write
how the French king offered to giue the bishop of Norwich fiftéene thousand marks to race

daies, to make herevnto a full and deliberate answer; which was granted, and in the

<p>In the same summer, the king with the queene went abroad in progresse, visiting in
their waie the rich abbeis of the realme, as Burie, Thetford, Norwich, &amp; other; going
about a great part of the realme. And when these newes came to him from the bishop
of Norwich, he was at Dauentrie in North­amp­ton­shire, and being the same time at supper,
he put the table from him, and rising with all hast, got him to horsbacke, and rode in
post that night, changing horsse diuerse times, with such spéed that he came to S. Albons
about midnight, and making no staie there longer than he had borowed the abbats gelding,
hasted foorth till he came to Westminster: so that it appeared he would neuer haue
rested till he had passed the sea, and giuen battell to the Frenchmen.
But after his comming
to Westminster, wearied with that hastie iournie, he got him to bed, and liked so
well of ease, that he thought good to send a lieutenant in his stead to passe the seas, to deliuer
the bishop from danger of his enemies.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

he protracted time, till the respit granted to the bishop to make answer was expired, and
so the bishop when he saw no succour come foorth of England, raced the towne as the
couenant was:
but monie he would not or did not receiue, bicause he thought in so dooing
he should offend the councell. At his comming backe into England, he found the duke
of Lancaster at the sea side with a great power of men readie to haue come ouer: although
some thought that he deferred time of purpose, for that he misliked of the bishops
whole enterprise; and now bicause it had thus quailed, he blamed the bishop for his
euill gouernement therein: but sir Hugh Caluerlie he reteined with him a time, dooing <span class="xxpn" id="p762">|762|</span>

When

Moreouer, the king tooke into his hands the temporalties that belonged to

They were

<p>The earle of Flanders was iudged most in blame, for that no peace could be accorded,
bicause he would not that the Gauntiners should be comprised therin, but the Englishmen
would not agree either to truce or peace, except regard might be had of the Gauntiners,

<p>In the lent season, the duke of Lancaster with his brother the earle of Buckingham
went towards the borders, hauing with him a mightie power of knights, esquiers, and
archers, and after he had remained a certeine time vpon the borders, about Easter he
entered Scotland, and comming within thrée miles of Edenburgh, he staied there three
daies, in which meane time the Scots conueied all their goods out of the towne ouer the
water of Firth: so that when the armie came thither, they found nothing but bare walles,
which gréeued the soldiers not a little. The Scots would not come foorth to giue anie
battell to the Englishmen, but got them into woods and mounteines, or else passed ouer
the riuer of Firth, suffering the Englishmen to fight with the vehement cold wether that
then sore annoied those parts, in so much that on Easter daie at night, through snow that
fell, and such extreame cold and boisterous stormes, as sore afflicted the armie, being incamped
within the compasse of a marish ground for their more suertie: there died aboue
fiue hundred horsses, to let passe the losse of men that perished at the same time, of

<p>About the same time, to wit, in the quindene of Easter, a parlement of the nobles was
holden at Salisburie, during the which an Irish frier of the order of the Carmelits, being a
bacheler in diuinitie, exhibited to the king a bill against the duke of Lancaster, charging
him with heinous treasons: as that he meant vpon a sudden to destroie the king, and to
vsurpe the crowne, shewing the time, the place, and circumstances of the whole contriued
matter. The king being yoong both in yeares and discretion, when he had heard the
friers information, called two of his chapleins vnto him, one sir Nicholas Slake, and
an other, and asked their aduise what they thought good to be doone in such a weightie
cause. Now as they were busie in talke about the same, the duke of Lancaster came into
the kings chamber after his woonted manner, not vnderstanding anie thing of the matter
whereof they were in talke. The king with a sterne countenance beheld the duke, not
dooing him the honor that he was accustomed. The duke suspecting that the king had
somewhat in his head that touched his person, withdrew. In the meane time those two
that were thus in counsell with the king, fearing happilie the dukes power, or else vpon
good will they bare towards him, persuaded the king that in anie wise he should call him,
to see and heare what was laid to his charge.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A miserable &amp; cruell torture.</p></div>

<p>The duke, after he had read the bill of his accusation, made such answer, and so excused
himselfe in declaring his innocencie, that the king gaue credit to his words, and
receiued his excuse. Herewith the duke besought the king, that the frier might be kept
in safe gard, till the time came that he might purge himselfe of that he had charged him
with; and that the lord Iohn Holland the kings halfe brother might haue the custodie of
him, till the day appointed that the duke should come to his full triall. The night before
which day, the said lord Holland, and sir Henrie Greene knight, came to this frier, and
putting a cord about his necke, tied the other end about his priuie members, &amp; after
hanging him vp from the ground, laid a stone vpon his bellie, with the weight whereof,
and peise of his bodie withall, he was strangled and tormented, so as his verie backe bone
burst in sunder therewith, besides the straining of his priuie members: thus with thrée
kind of tormentings he ended his wretched life. On the morow after, they caused his
dead corps to be drawne about the towne, to the end it might appeare he had suffered
worthilie for his great falshood &amp; treason. Which extreame punishment and exquisite
kind of execution, had it not béene meritoriouslie inflicted vpon so impudent an offender,

<p>But now to the parlement. At length, when the K. had obteined of the laitie a grant

borderers of England and Scotland made rodes ech into others countries, to the great
disquieting of both the realmes. Among other rodes that the Englishmen made, shortlie
after Easter (as Froissard saith) the earles of North­um­ber­land and Nottingham, raising
an armie of 2000 speares, and six thousand archers, entered Scotland by Rockesburgh,
burnt the countrie euen to Edenburgh, and so returned without damage. In the meane
time came messengers from the French king, to aduertise the Scots of the conclusion of
the truce. But the Scots prouoked with this last inuasion made by the Englishmen into
their countrie, would not heare of any truce, till they had in part reuenged their displesure
vpon the Englishmen: and so with certeine men of armes of France, that latelie
before were come thither, not yet vnderstanding of any truce, they roded into North­um­ber­land,
doing what mischiefe they might: so that for the summer season of this yeare,
either part sought to indamage other (as Walsingham saith) though Froissard writeth,
that through the earnest trauell of the messengers that came to intimate the abstinence of
war taken, the parties now that their stomachs were well eased with the interchange of indamaging
either others confins, agréed to be quiet, and so the truce was proclamed in both

<p>About the beginning of August in the eighth yéere of this kings reigne, the duke of
Lancaster went ouer againe into France, to treat of peace; but after he had remained
there a long time, &amp; spent no small store of treasure, he returned with a truce, to indure

foorth of the relme, Iohn de Northampton, that had borne such rule in the citie of London,
whilest he was maior, and also after (as partlie ye haue heard) was accused by a
chapleine (that he had in his house) of seditious sturs, which he went about, so that being
arreigned thereof, he was in the end condemned to perpetuall prison, and the same not to
be within the space of one hundred miles at the least of the citie of London. All his
goods were confiscated, and so he was sent to the castell of Tintagill in Cornewall, and
the kings officers seized vpon his goods &amp; cattels.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ About</span> the feast of saint Martine,

<p>During this parlement also, a combat was fought within lists betwixt an English esquier,

though not iustlie, but mooued through displeasure, conceiued of an iniurie doone to him
by the same Walsh, whilest he was vnder capteine or vicedeputie (as we may call him) of
Chierburgh, in abusing the Nauarrois wife. Wherevpon when the Nauarrois was vanquished

<p>Furthermore before the said parlement was dissolued, newes came foorth of the north
parts, that the Scots had woone the castell of Berwike: for which the earle of North­um­ber­land,
that was capteine thereof, was put in high blame, for that he had not committed
the kéeping thereof to more circumspect persons. The duke of Lancaster,
who bare no <span class="xxpn" id="p765">|765|</span>
good will to the said earle, was well appaid that he had so good matter to charge his
aduersarie withall, so that through his meanes the earle of North­um­ber­land was sore
accused, and had much adoo to escape the danger of being reputed a traitor. Wherevpon
great occasion of malice and displeasure grew betwixt those two noble personages, as
after it well appeared. But howsoeuer the matter was handled, the earle was licenced by
the king to go into his countrie, and séeke to recouer possession of the castell thus latelie
lost. Wherevpon raising an armie, &amp; besieging the Scots that were within the castell,
he so constreined them, that for the summe of 2000 marks they surrendred the fortresse
into his hands, their liues and goods saued: and so the earle of North­um­ber­land recouered

But how soeuer it was, he being warned thereof by some of the councell, got him to his
castell of Pomfret, which he fortified, and banded himselfe so with his fréends, that it
appeared he would defend his cause with force of armes, rather than to come to his triall
by order of law afore such a iudge: and by reason hereof, it was greatlie doubted, least
some ciuill warre would haue broken foorth. But through the earnest labour of the

<p>About the same time the French king sent into Scotland the admerall of France, with a

followed himselfe, with all conuenient spéed that might be. At his comming into the
parts about Yorke, he was informed that the Scots and Frenchmen were withdrawne vpon
the duke Lancasters approch towards them, but the king thought to kéepe on his iournie.
Whilest he was lodged in those parts, a great mischance happened, by reason of variance

doubting in what sort his déed might be taken, fled straight vnto Beuerlie, and there tooke

they might behold all the English armie, as the same passed vnderneath them by a passage

threescore thousand archers, and other men of warre; where the Scots and Frenchmen
were not past a thousand speares, and thirtie thousand of all other sorts, and the most part
of those but euill armed. Therefore they determined vpon an other point, which was
to inuade England in an other quarter, whilest the Englishmen burnt vp their countrie,

<p>In this ninth yeare of king Richard (though by other writers it should séeme to be

went into Spaine, and lead with him thither his wife the ladie Constance, &amp; a daughter
which he had by hir named Katharine, and two other daughters which he had by his former
wife. He had béene about the preparing of an armie, and all furniture necessarie
for this iournie two or thrée yéeres before, and therefore hauing now seauen gallies and
eightéene ships sent to him out of Portingale (which arriued at Bristow) he caused all such
vessels as he had prouided to resort likewise thither, where making his generall assemblie,
when all his men of warre were come togither, he bestowed them aboord, with all their <span class="xxpn" id="p769">|769|</span>

of his whole fléet sir Thomas Percie; and sir Iohn Holland that was after created earle

<p>As they passed by Britaine, they landed at Brest, the capteine whereof, at that time
named sir Iohn Rooche, finding himselfe greatlie annoied by the Frenchmen that were
lodged in two bastides erected before the castell, declared to the duke in what state he
stood. Wherevpon he caused the said bastides to be assailed, which was doone by the
lord Fitz Walter, and others, who bare themselues so manfullie, that the bastides were
woone, broken downe, and a great preie with prisoners obteined, although not without
losse of diuerse valiant personages. Thus were they within Brest castell deliuered of
their vnfreendlie neighbours by the duke of Lancaster and his people. Who hauing doone
their feat tooke the seas, and sailed foorth till they came on the coasts of Gallis, where
on S. Laurence eeuen, they arriued in the hauen of Groigne, otherwise called Coron,
and there they vnshipped all their prouisions, determining to inuade the countrie on that
side.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ Héere,</span> bicause it is not vnprofitable to know the absolute truth of things doone,
by the collection of writers, I haue translated the beseeging of Brest, as the same is set
downe by Henrie Knighton in his annales, in a larger and more ample sort, with a fuller
certificat of circumstances than hath hitherto béene declared. At the same time (saith he)
the duke of Britaine had laid siege both by sea and land, to a certeine towne in Britaine,
in old time subiect to the king of England, which was called Brest, with a great multitude
of Frenchmen and Britains. Now on the twelfth of the kalends of Iulie, he began to build
a fort before the said towne of Brest, of a woonderful bignesse, the walles thereof being <span class="xxpn" id="p770">|770|</span>
ten foot thicke, and seauen towres about it. A thousand workmen did worke daie by
daie vpon it, and to defend the said workemen (that they might not be hindered in their
businesse by the citizens) ten thousand fighting men were appointed. So that this fort
was begun and ended in ninetéene daies space, and called the Doouehouse, bicause a
doouehouse stood in the same place before. Furthermore he stored this fort with all
necessaries, as vittels, armour, guns, and other engins, and he placed therein as capteine
of the warriors the lord Iohn Maletret with a hundred and fiftie armed men, and as
manie other soldiors, the whole number being thrée
hundred.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The good duke of Lancaster hauing knowledge hereof, directed his fléet or nauie towards
the hauen of Brest, where when he had arriued, they all fled from the siege, both
by sea and land, those onlie, which were in the fort, remaining behind. Now the prior
of S. Iames in Calis desired the good duke that he might giue the first assault against the
fort; who taking the repulse with his retinue, he ceased and gaue ouer. In like sort did
manie more giue the assault to the same for the space of two daies and more: in somuch
that some digging vnder the wals, and vndermining the foundations of one towre,
the same fell downe vpon sir Robert Swinarton a valiant knight of Staffordshire, and
manie more, among whome was Iohn de Bolton a couragious gentleman and an esquier
by degree of Yorkeshire. As for those that were vpon the towre, they also came tumbling
downe, and were presentlie slaine.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Philip the duke of Lancasters daughter married to the king of Portingale.</p></div>

<p>In the meane time the lord Maletret gardian of the fort, sent word to the duke of
Lancaster, that he would yeeld and surrender the hold into his hands vpon condition,
that he and all his might freelie depart with such armour, goods, chatels and victuals as
they had reposed and laid vp in store for their necessarie prouision: wherevnto the good
duke (as he was alwaies good) verie gentlie agréed; vpon condition also, that before their
departure, they should ruinate the said fort, and laie it eeuen with the ground; and
should likewise allow and paie him towards his costs and charges defraied in the siege of
the same, twentie thousand scutes of gold. Then might you sée the people flocking from
all parts of the countrie, some with beires, some with cabbins, some with carts, and some
with crutches to fetch awaie the dead and the wounded: in so much that there was not
one, either slaine outright, or deadlie maimed, for whome his freends did not mone and
lament. Yea, the lord Maletret himselfe was so mangled and hurt, that he could not go
on his legs, but as he leaned on mens shoulders, and was borne vp on either side. It
was reported, that manie dead bodies were hidden in heaps of salt, to the end that the
Englishmen should not glorie and triumph in the multitude of the slaine, of whome [in
sight] the number amounted to aboue 150. Thus farre goeth Henrie Knighton, whose
report giueth no small light to the matter vnder hand. After the duke had remained a
moneth at Groigne, he went to Compostella, and there soiourned for a season, during the
which, his constable sir Iohn Holland woone diuerse townes and fortresses which the
enemies kept: diuerse yeelded to the duke with better will, for that the duchesse his
wife was there with him, whom they knew to be right inheritour to the realme.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ At</span>
Mouson a towne on the confines betwixt Spaine and Portingale, the king of Portingale and

being togither at Mouson, for their iournie to be made into Castile) the said king assembled
an armie of a thousand men of armes, and ten thousand other souldiers, with
the which entring the confines of Castile, he first tooke the towne of Feroule, and after <span class="xxpn" id="p771">|771|</span>

<p>Variance amongst writers.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ Here</span>
the English writers make mention of a battell, which the constable of Castile
should giue to the duke, and that the victorie remained on the dukes side, and the
Spaniards chased out of the field. But Froissard (who liued in those daies, and learned
that which he wrote of those that were with the duke in his iournie) maketh no remembrance
of any such thing, but that contrarilie the king of Castile folowing the aduise of
such Frenchmen as were sent into Spaine to aid him, caused all the riches of the countrie
to be brought into the walled townes and fortresses, which he stuffed with men of warre,
to defend them from the Englishmen and Portingales; and further to cut off their vitels,
and to kéepe them from hauing forage abroad in the countrie, vnlesse such as were sent
were garded with the greater troops for their suertie and defense.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Great death in the English host in Spaine by

<p>Thus bestowing the most part of all such men of warre, both Frenchmen and Spaniards,

not to giue battell till his enimies had wearied themselues in keeping of the fields,
and that a new power was come to his aid out of France, which he dailie looked for. By
which means it came to passe, that the Englishmen not vsed to such hot aire as they
found in those parts in that season of the yeare (for it was about Midsummer) fell dailie
into manie perillous diseases, whereof no small number died; and other became so
faint, that they were not able to helpe themselues, that to consider the miserie in which
they were, it would haue rued the harts of their verie foes. Herevpon was the duke constreined

through Spaine to France, had safe conducts sealed and signed by the king of Spaine;
but scarse the halfe of those that came out of England with the duke, returned thither
againe, they died so fast, aswell after the breaking vp of their campe, as before.
Amongst other, there died before the breaking vp of the campe, one of the greatest barons
of all the companie, named the lord Fitz Walter; and afterwards within the towne of
Ville Arpent, there died (as Froissard saith) three great barons of England, and men of
great possessions: sir Richard Burlie a knight of the garter, who had béene as it were

purposing to inuade Englād.</p></div>

<p>And first it is not to be forgotten, that the Frenchmen neuer shewed more vanitie
than they did this yeare, since the linage of the Capetes began first to rule in France.
All the ships that they could prouide from the confines of Spaine, vnto the mouth of the
Rhene, all alongst the coast, they assembled at Sluis and thereabouts, and made so great
preparation for the warre, that the like had not béene heard of (meaning, as they boasted,
and made their vants) to passe ouer into England, and to deuoure the whole countrie,
in dooing sacrifice to the soules of their elders with the bloud of the English people.

<p class="pcontinue">There were numbred in the moneth of September about Sluis, Dam, and Blankberke 1287
ships, besides those which were rigged in Britaine by the constable, who had caused an
inclosure of a field to be made of timber, like railes or barriers, that when they were
landed in England, they might therewith inclose their field, and so lodge more at suertie,
and when they remooued, it was so made with ioints, that they might take it vp in péeces

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ Not­with­stand­ing</span>
the great confidence which the French king reposed in the fortification
which he had imbarked, thinking thereby to haue wrought great woonders, to the
discomfiture of the English: yet (contrarie to his expectation) it so fortuned, that about
Michaelmas, the lord William Beauchampe capteine of Calis tooke two ships; whereof
one was loden with a péece of the said inclosure or wall of wood, and in the same ship
was the maister carpenter of the inclosure, being an Englishman borne, but banished his
countrie before that time for some offense. He also tooke another ship, wherein were
engins, guns, gunpowder &amp; other instruments of war. Not long after this, two more
ships were taken likewise, whose burthen was parcels of the foresaid frame or inclosure:
so that three ships were met withall and seized vpon, each of them loden with one kind
of stuffe. Whereof king Richard hearing, he caused the said inclosure to be reared and
set vp about Winchelsie towne. In the meane while, namelie in September, the foresaid
armie came into Flanders, and arriued at the hauen of Sluis, intending to make their
progresse into England: but by prolonging of the time there, they were driuen to great
distresse and want of vittels: for it was reported that a loafe of bread, sold in England
for a penie, was sold there for eighteene pence, and a hens eg for a penie: so that in the
end of Nouember they returned to France, missing their purpose as much as if they had
neuer ment it.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The Londoners speciallie afraid of the Frēch forces.</p></div>

<p>There were readie within the realme at that season, in one part and other 100000
archers, and ten thousand men of armes, besides those that were gone into Spaine with
the duke of Lancaster. All this preparation lasted for the more part of the summer,
euen till the beginning of winter: and still the French king that was come downe into
Flanders, staied for the comming of his vncle the duke of Berrie: who at length in the
moneth of Nouember came to Sluis, hauing protracted time, of purpose, that he might
by the excuse of winter, cause this iornie to be put off till another season. Wherein he
shewed more wit than all the councellors which the French king had about him: for if he
had not politikelie shifted off the matter, the king had landed here in England, to the great
danger of his person and losse of his people. And yet if we shall beléeue writers that
liued in those daies, by reason of the brute that was spred through the realme, of that
huge preparation which the French king made to inuade this land, no small feare entered
into the harts of manie, namelie of the Londoners, who (as if the enimies had beene
alredie landed) bestirred them, in making what prouision they might for their defense,
though it séemed by their manner of dooings, they stood in doubt least the whole realme

<p>In déed diuerse were the more afraid, for that they percieued how the barons and
great lords agreed not in manie points among themselues, and so being not of one mind,
the wiser sort doubted least through their disagréeing in that troublesome time, some
danger might grow to the state of the whole realme. Not­with­stand­ing, no small number
of others wished nothing more, than that the French king in going forward with his purpose,
might haue come ouer, not doubting but that he should haue found such a welcome,
as would haue beene little to his ease. About the feast of saint Michaell, a
parlement was called and holden at London, and withall great numbers of men of armes
&amp; archers were appointed to come and lie about London, that they might be readie to
march foorthwith against the enimies whensoeuer it chanced them to land. Thus all the
townes and villages twentie miles in compasse round about London, were full of men of
armes and archers, lieing as it had beene in campe; and wanting both vittels and monie,
they were driuen to spoile and to take by violence what they might get. At length, after
they had laine thus to small purpose a long season, they were licenced to depart home,
with commandement to be readie to returne againe vpon the first summons. Manie of
them were constreined through necessitie, to sell their horsses,
and armour, and some <span class="xxpn" id="p774">|774|</span>
to spoile and to rob as they went homewards, not sparing what they might laie their
hands vpon. Although the men of warre were dismissed home, the parlement yet continued,
and the lords still remained at London, hearkening still for the French kings
comming.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Robert Véer marquesse of Dubline created duke of Ireland.</p></div>

<p>The lord Robert Véer earle of Oxenford, whome the king in the last parlement had
made marquesse of Dubline, was now in this parlement created duke of Ireland: the
other lords sore enuieng so high preferment in a man that so little deserued, as they
tooke it. For by reason of the kings great affection which he bare not onelie to this noble
man, but also to the lord Michael de la Poole, whom he had latelie created earle of Suffolke,
and after aduanced him to the office of lord chancellor (as before ye haue heard)
not onelie the lords, but also the commons sore grudged at such their high preferrement,
in somuch that in this present parlement, the knights &amp; burgesses in the lower house,
exhibited a bill against the lord chancellor, of diuerse crimes which they laid to his
charge, and so vsed the matter, with the helpe of the lords, that in the end in some
respect they had their willes against him, contrarie to the kings mind, as after may
appeare.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>And where the king had demanded a reliefe of monie towards the maintenance of his
estate, and charges of the warres, it was answered, that he néeded not any tallage of his
subiects, sith he might furnish himselfe with such a summe at the hands of the said earle,
that was iustlie indebted vnto him therein, as they were able well to prooue. But the
king was nothing herewith contented, conceiuing no small displeasure, aswell against
them of the lower house, as against the lords in the vpper, for fauouring them in the
lower, in matters that went so sore against his mind. Herevpon (as was said, whether
trulie or otherwise, the lord knoweth) by a conspiracie begun betwixt the king &amp; such as
were most in fauour with him, it was deuised, that the duke of Glocester (as principall)
and such other lords as fauored the knights and burgesses in their sute, against the earle
of Suffolke, and were otherwise against the king in his demand of monie, should be willed
to a supper in London, there to be murthered.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Richard Exton iustlie cōmended.</p></div>

<p>But the duke comming by some meanes to vnderstand of this wicked practise, had no
desire to take part of that supper, where such sharpe sauce was prouided, and withall
gaue warning to the residue, that they likewise should not come there, but to content
themselues with their owne suppers at their lodgings. It was said, that sir Nicholas
Brember, who had béene maior the yeare before, had promised his assistance in the
execution of this horrible fact: but thorough the commendable constancie of Richard
Exton that was maior this yeare being mooued by the king for his furtherance therein,
and denieng flatlie to consent to the death of such innocent persons, that heinous practise
was omitted. This matter being brought to light, the hatred and malice which men
bare to such councellors of the king greatlie increased, and the duke of Glocester and
such as withstood the king, dailie grew more and more into the peoples fauour.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A subsidie granted and appointed to be spent according to <span class="nowrap">y<sup>e</sup></span> discretion of the nobilitie.</p></div>

<p>Howbeit at length, through the earnest sute of some of the great lords, there was
granted to the king halfe a tenth and halfe a fiftéenth, which should not be spent at the
pleasure of the prince, but by the order and appointment of the said lords, &amp; so at length
the earle of Arundell was appointed to receiue it, to furnish him with a nauie to the seas.
But before this paiment might be granted, there was much adoo, &amp; hard hold: for where
the said earle of Suffolke then lord chancellor, at first had demanded of the commons in
the kings name, foure fiftéens (for with lesse (said he) the king could not mainteine his
estate and the warres which he had in hand) the whole bodie of the parlement made
answer thereto, that without the king were present (for he was then at Eltham) they
could make therein no answer at all: and herewith they tooke occasion at length to say
further, that except the said earle of Suffolke were remooued from the office of chan­cel­lor­ship,
they would meddle no further with any act in this parlement, were it neuer of so
small importance. <span class="xxpn" id="p775">|775|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The king being aduertised hereof, sent againe to the commons, that they should send
vnto Eltham (where he laie) fortie of the wisest and best learned of the common house,
the which in the name of the whole house should declare vnto him their minds. And
then the house was in no small feare, by reason of a brute that was raised, how the king
sought meanes to intrap and destroie them that followed not his purpose. Herevpon
aswell the lords of the vpper house as the commons of the lower assembled togither, and
agréed with one consent, that the duke of Glocester, and Thomas Arundell bishop of
Elie, should in the name of the whole parlement be sent to the king vnto Eltham: which
was doone, and the king was well contented that they should come. When they came
before his presence, with humble reuerence they declared their message, which consisted
in these points: That the lords and commons assembled at that present in parlement,
besought him of his lawfull fauour, that they might liue in peace and tranquillitie vnder
him.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>And oftener if néed require.</p>

<p>The causes &amp; conditions of a parlement.</p></div>

<p>They further declared, that one old statute and laudable custome was approued, which
no man could denie, that the king once in the yeare might lawfullie summon his high
court of parlement, and call the lords and commons therevnto, as to the highest court of
his realme, in which court all right and equitie ought to shine as the sunne being at the
highest, whereof poore and rich may take refreshing; where also reformation ought to be
had of all oppressions, wrongs, extortions, &amp; enormities within the realme; and there the
king ought to take counsell with the wise men of his realme, for the maintenance of his
estate, and conseruation of the same. And if it might be knowen that any persons within
the realme or without, intended the contrarie; there must also be deuised how such
euill weeds may be destroied. There must also be studied and foreséene, that if any
charge doo come vpon the king and realme, how it may be honorablie borne and discharged.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Absence of the king from the parlement for the space of 40 daies.</p>

<p>The kings answer.</p></div>

<p>Further, they declared that till that present, his subiects (as was thought) had louinglie
demeaned themselues towards him, in aiding him with their substance to the best of their
powers, &amp; that their desire was to vnderstand how those goods were spent. And further
they said, they had one thing to declare vnto him, how that by an old ordinance it was
enacted, that if the king should absent himselfe fourtie daies, not being sicke, and refuse
to come to the parlement, without regard to the charges of his people, and their great
paines, they then may lawfullie returne home to their houses: and therefore sith he had
béene absent a long time, and yet refused to come among them, it was greatlie to their
discomfort. To this the king (as we find) made this answer: “Well, we do perceiue
that our people and commons go about to rise against vs: wherefore we thinke we cannot
doo better than to aske aid of our cousine the French king, and rather submit vs vnto him
than to our owne subiects.”<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Wealth of the people is the glorie of the prince and suertie of his reigne.</p></div>

<p>The lords answered, that it should not be good for him so to doo, but a waie rather to
bring him into extreame danger, sith it was plaine inough, that the French king was his
ancient enimie and greatest aduersarie, who if he might once set foot in the realme of
England, he would rather despoile and dispossesse the king of his kingdome, than put his
helping hand to relieue him. He might (they said) call to remembrance, how his noble
progenitour king Edward the third, his grandfather, and prince Edward his father had
trauelled in heat and cold, with great anguish and troubles incessantlie, to make a conquest
of France, that rightfullie apperteined vnto them, and now to him, in which wars
he might likewise remember how manie lords, noble men, and good commons of both
realmes had lost their liues, and what charges both the realmes likewise bare in mainteining
those warres: and now (the more pitie) greater burthens were laid vpon the necks of
the English subiects for the supportation of his charges, by reason whereof, they were so
low brought (said they) that they haue not to paie their rents, and so by such meanes was
his power decaied, his lords brought behind hand, and all his people sore impouerished.
And as that king cannot be poore that hath rich people, so cannot he be rich that
hath <span class="xxpn" id="p776">|776|</span>
poore commons. And as he tooke hurt by such in­con­uen­i­en­ces chancing through euill
councellors that were about him, so the lords and noblemen susteined no lesse hurt each
one after his estate and calling. And if remedie were not in time prouided through his
helping hand, the realme must needs fall in ruine, and the default should be imputed to
him and to those his euill councellors.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Change of officers by the parlement.</p>

<p>The earle of Suffolke gréeuouslie charged
by the parlement house for sundrie offenses.</p></div>

<p>By these and the like persuasions the king was induced to come to the parlement, and
according to his appointment he came indeed. Soone after his comming was Iohn Fortham
bishop of Durham discharged of his office of lord treasuror, and in his place was
appointed one Iohn Gilbert bishop of Hereford, that was a frier of the order of preachers,
a man more eloquent than faithfull, as some reported of him. Also the earle of Suffolke
was discharged of his office of lord chancellor, and Thomas Arundell bishop of Elie placed
in his roome, by whole consent of parlement. The same earle of Suffolke was charged
with manie &amp; verie great enormious crimes, frauds, falshoods, and tresons, which he
had practised, to the great preiudice of the king and realme, and therevpon was committed
to ward in the castell of Windsore. Not­with­stand­ing they adiudged him not to death
(as some write) nor disgraded him of the honor of knighthood, but condemned him to
paie a fine of twentie thousand marks, and also to forfeit one thousand pounds of yéerelie
rents which he had purchased.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But other write, that not­with­stand­ing the king was sore offended for the accusations
brought against the said earle of Suffolke and others, whome he loued, and was loth to
heare anie euill of: yet he was constreined at length, after he had shifted off the matter
by sundrie deuises, to appoint certeine persons with full power and authoritie to heare,
and in iudgment to determine those matters. The duke of Glocester therfore, and the
earle of Arundell were appointed as iudges; which (whilest the king as yet was absent,
who got him foorth of the waie of purpose, bicause he would not be present at the condemnation
of those whome he most entierlie loued and fauoured) went earnestlie in hand
with their businesse, and so at length (as Walsingham saith) the earle of Suffolke was conuicted,
&amp; found giltie of sundrie crimes, trespasses, and naughtie parts: for which it
was thought that he deserued to lose his life &amp; goods, but yet he was suffered (as the
same Walsingham saith) to go abroad vnder suertie, certeine great men being bound
for him in great sums of monie. But what order soeuer was taken for the punishment
of him, sure it is he was displaced from his office of chan­cel­lor­ship, as before yée haue
heard.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Thirtéene lords appointed by parlement to haue the

<p>Furthermore, the lords, and other estates in this parlement, considering that through
couetousnesse of the new deposed officers, the kings treasure had béene imbezeled, lewdlie
wasted, &amp; prodigallie spent, nothing to his profit: there were in this parlement thirteene
lords chosen, to haue ouersight vnder the king of the whole gouernment of the realme, as
by their commission in the statutes of the tenth yeare of this king it dooth in the booke of
statutes at large appeare. Of those thirteene there were thrée of the new officers named,
as the bishop of Elie lord chancellor, the bishop of Hereford lord treasuror, and Nicholas

archbishop of Canturburie, Alexander archbishop of Yorke, Edmund Langlie duke of
Yorke, Thomas duke of Glocester, William bishop of Winchester, Thomas bishop of
Excester, Richard earle of Arundell, Richard lord Scroope, and Iohn lord Debereux.
But this participation of the gouernement fell out to be inconuenient, as by processe
of the storie shall appeare, euen to those vnto whome it was allotted: so that no small

recouer such lands as the king had giuen to him. For aswell the lords as the commons
were so desirous to haue him gone, that they wished the realme rather to spare so much
treasure, than to haue his presence about the king, to allure him to follie. The same
time the king of Armenia sued for a safe conduct to come againe ouer into this land, to
speake with the king as it had been about the moouing of some peace betwixt the two

lords, these men putting into his eare, that he was like no king but rather resembled the
shadow of one; saieng, it would come to passe that he should be able to doo nothing of
himselfe, if the lords might inioy the authoritie which they had taken vpon them. The
king gaue credit to these tales, and therefore had the lords in great gelousie, not­with­stand­ing
they were thought to be his most true and faithfull subiects, and the
other craftie, <span class="xxpn" id="p778">|778|</span>
deceitfull, and vntrustie; but such an affection had the king to them, that no informations,
nor accusations, though neuer so manifestlie prooued, could bring them out of his fauour,
in so much as at the feast of Christmasse next following, he caused the earle of Suffolke
to sit with him at his owne table, in robes accustomablie appointed for kings to weare,
and not for meaner estates, which was much noted, and no little increased the enuie

<p>The earle of Arundell goeth to the sea with 500 men
of armes and a thousand archers as <i>Froissard</i> noteth.</p>

<p>A great abuse in choise souldiers.</p></div>

<p>About the beginning of March in this tenth yeere, Richard earle of Arundell, being
appointed lord admerall, &amp; Thomas Mowbraie earle of Notingham, the earle of Deuonshire,
and the bishop of Norwich (as Froissard saith) went to the sea with a warlike
power of men of armes and archers, so well trimmed and appointed as was possible. For
the lord admerall vnderstanding that the duke of Glocester, and manie other noblemen
would sée the muster of his men, vsed all diligence, and spared for no costs, to haue the
most choisest and pikedst fellowes that might be gotten, not following the euill example of
others in times past, which receiued tag and rag to fill vp their numbers, whom they hired
for small wages, and reserued the residue to their pursses. And when to the aduancement
of the realms commoditie they should haue incountered the enimies, they shifted off all
occasions thereto, and onelie prolonged time, without atchiuing any enterprise auaileable,
to the end they might receiue the whole wages, and kéepe themselues from danger, which
they should hardlie haue auoided, when they had not about them such able men as were
like to match the enimies: but the earle of Arundell contrarilie got the ablest men he
might, not sparing his owne pursse, to the end that by their seruice he might atchiue some
worthie enterprise, to redound vnto the commoditie of his countrie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>A good policie.</p>

<p>A great victorie of the English nauie against the Flemish fléet,

<p>After the duke of Glocester had beheld so faire and chosen a power of men of warre,
they were streightwaies appointed to get them on shipbrood, &amp; so being imbarked, the
whole nauie passed foorth to the Thams mouth, where they staied to watch for the fléet of
Flanders, that was readie to come from Rochell with wines. At length, vpon a sundaie,
being the euen of the Annuntiation of our ladie, the Flemish fleet was discouered a good
way off, by one that was mounted into one of the tops of a ship of the English fléet. The
earle of Arundell greatlie reioising at those newes, foorthwith with his whole fléet made to
the sea. When the Flemings approched neere to our nauie, they made saile, as if they
would set vpon the same; and our men of purpose made countenance as if they would
haue retired, as mistrusting themselues to be able to match their aduersaries, who coueting
rather a safe passage than battell, passed by: but the Englishmen hauing once got the
wind fit for their purpose, suddenlie set vpon the Flemish ships, and fought with them
right fiercelie: at length, after a sore conflict which indured foure houres, the victorie fell
to the Englishmen.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p><i>Ia. Meir.</i> <i>Thom. Wals.</i></p></div>

<p>There were taken fourescore ships, with diuerse capteins and men of armes, namelie
their chiefe admerall, named Iohn Buicke, a perfect good seaman, and one that had aforetime
doone much hurt to the English nation. Diuerse of their ships were bouged, and
some escaped from the battell. But the earle of Arundell pursued them so egerlie for the
space of two daies togither, that at length he tooke them, and brought them backe to his
nauie, so that what in the battell and in the chase, there were taken of great and small, to
the number of an hundred vessels, all fraught with wines, so that there was found aboord
the same nine thousand tuns, or rather (as other saie) ninetéene thousand, which togither
with the vessels were streight sent vnto Orwell hauen, and to other hauens abroad in the
realme, beside that which fell to the kings share, as due to him by his prerogatiue. Part
of the Flemish fléet escaping (as before ye haue heard) was pursued vnto the hauen of
Sluis and Blankerke.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The liberalitie of the earle of Arundell.</p></div>

<p>The citizens of Middleburgh came to the earle, and requested him that they might buie
those wines of him, and paie for the same after the rate of an hundred shillings the tunne,
alledging how they were the kings fréends, and stood in néed of wines: but the earle of
Arundell, thinking it more reason that those which had borne the charges of his iournie, <span class="xxpn" id="p779">|779|</span>
to wit, the commons of the realme of England should haue the commoditie thereof than any
other, he denied their sute. But yet to shew them some pleasure as his fréends, he gaue
them twentie tuns to make merrie with. As for that which fell to the earles share, he
vsed such bountifulnesse in bestowing it among his fréends, that he left not to himselfe so
much as one tunne. He wan therefore no small praise, that forbearing his owne commoditie,
which he might haue reaped in selling those wines to strangers, he had more
regard to the profit of the commons, whereby they might vnderstand, that that which they
had laid foorth towards the setting forward of his iournie, was not altogither lost nor cast
awaie. By this meanes (besides the commendation which he drew to himselfe) he also
wan the harts &amp; good will of the people, whose freendship is purchased by gifts and good
déeds, sith they make profit the metrod of amitie, &amp; bound in beneuolence with receiued
benefits, as the poet saith,<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>All the countrie of Flanders neere to the sea coasts, was in great feare: for the Englishmen
landed, and euerie day went abroad into the countrie, burning diuerse townes and
villages, as Mude, Osiburge, Houckam, Monachacedam, &amp; others. And at length, after
they had taken their pleasure in the countrie, for the space of ten daies togither, they
hoissed vp sailes, and returned with all their preie and booties, which being sold, and
vttered abroad in the realme, made wine so plentifullie here in England, that it was sold
for thirtéene shillings foure pence the tun, and twentie shillings the best and choisest.
The earle of Arundell not satisfied with his happie atchiued enterprise, but minding to
doo more seruice to the benefit of his countrie, gathered his ships together, and hiring
new souldiers to supplie the roomes of them that were hurt, maimed, or slaine, turned his
sailes towards the castell of Brest, which seemed to be a keie to the lesse Britaine, and
being (as yee haue heard) in the Englishmens possession, the Frenchmen were about
to raise vp and build farre greater and stronger bastillions, than those were that the
duke of Lancaster had taken and destroied, as he sailed forward on his iournie toward
Spaine.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>One of these two new bastiles the earle of Arundell woone by force from them that kept
it: and bicause it séemed necessarie to be kept for a defense to the castell, if it were in the
Englishmens hands, he committed it to the custodie of certeine Englishmen. The other
being not yet finished, but begun in sumptuous wise to be builded, he set on fire and
burned. This doone, furnishing the garison with sufficient vittels and munition to serue
them for one whole yeare, he returned home into England, with great praise and commendation
of the commons for his dooings. But the duke of Ireland the earle of Suffolke,
sir Simon de Burlie, and sir Richard Sturrie, that still continued about the king,
séemed rather to enuie the earle of Arundels good name, than otherwise to commend
him and others to the king, that had béene foorth in that iournie, in so much that when
the earle of Nottingham, otherwise called earle Marshall, that had béene euer the kings
plaifellow, and of equall age to him, came now to the court, hoping to be right welcome,
and to receiue great thankes at the kings hands, he had no good countenance shewed
vnto him, neither of the king, nor of the duke of Ireland, who disdaining once to talke

<p>Shortlie after, by the counsell of those lords and knights that remained about the king,
the lord Henrie Percie, sonne to the earle of North­um­ber­land, was sent to the seas, to
beate backe the attempts of the enimies, but he was slenderlie appointed to atchiue anie
great enterprise. This was doone of some enuious purpose, bicause he had got a name
amongest the common people, to be a verie hardie and valiant gentleman, as well among
Englishmen, as Scots. But he either ignorant, or not much waieng of that which they
craftilie had imagined against him, boldlie and valiantlie executed the businesse inioined

had béene confessor to the duke of Lancaster, obteined in fauour of the same duke, at
pope Vrbans hands, certeine faculties, to be distributed to such as would praie &amp;

<p>Now bicause such as obteined this fauour, inioied great liberties, manie were glad to
bestow largelie, to be so preferred, the frier being redie to admit those that offered most.
Among other, one Peter Pateshull, a frier of the Augustines order, was made by him the
popes chapleine, a man not vnlearned, and one that fauoured Wicliffes doctrine, and
therevpon forsaking his priuate profession, gaue himselfe to a publike trade of life, which
might séeme to him more holie, commendable, and sure. Herevpon, he tooke vpon him
to preach against his owne order, namelie in a sermon which he made in saint Christophers
church in London. He inueied so earnestlie against the abuses and heinous
crimes which the friers, sometimes his brethren, vsed to put in practise, that it was an
horror to heare. There were present an hundred at the least of Wicliffes opinion at his
sermon. Now in the meane while that he so laid foorth what he knew against his late
brethren, some persons there were that ran to the Augustine friers, and declared the
whole matter; wherevpon a dozen of the hardiest and lustiest fellowes among them came
to the church, where this Pateshull was preaching, and hearing what was said, they began
to be sore mooued, insomuch that one of them more zealous in his religion than the other,
stepped foorth, and gainesaid those things which the preacher proponed.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A libell by frier Pateshull against his brethren.</p></div>

<p>When the Wicleuists perceiued this, they set vpon him that so disquieted the congregation,
and laieng hands on him, threw him downe, trode him vnder their féet, and lent him
manie a good buffet: and chasing all the other friers awaie, they were fullie bent to haue
killed them, and set their house on fier, crieng out with lowd voices; “Let vs destroie
these murtherers, let vs burne these Sodomits, and hang vp such traitors of the king and
realme.” And running thus with such a furious noise and outrage, they purposed verelie
to haue set fire on the friers lodgings, but that through the humble praier of frier Thomas
Ashborne, and one that was his fellow, being reputed for two good men, and doctors of
diuinitie, they were staied. The comming also of one of the shirifes of London holpe
much to appease them, so that by his persuasion, they returned home to their houses.
But Peter Pateshull, being mainteened among them, was counselled, sith he was interrupted
in his sermon, to set downe in writing all such matters as he was about to intreat
of, &amp; what he knew further. He therefore deuised a libell, in which he accused diuerse
of his brethren, of murthering sundrie of their fellowes.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>And for more proofe to be giuen to his saiengs, he told the names of them that were
made awaie, and the names also of the murtherers, and shewed where those that were
murthered were buried. He affirmed further, that the said friers his brethren of late,
were Sodomits and traitors, both to the king and realme, and manie other things he declared
(too too bad) in that his writing or libell which he fastned vpon the church doore
of S. Paule in London, that the more confusion might thereby redound vnto his late
brethren, the friers aforesaid. In the beginning of the same libell he protested, that he
was got foorth of the diuels dungeon, and through the grace of God escaped from amongst
wicked and filthie persons; by reason whereof, and for that he was an auoucher of the
veritie, he said, he was sure to suffer great aduersities at the friers hands, if they might
laie hold on him. But he thanked pope Vrbane, for that through his grant he had obteined
such libertie, that by help of his fréends, he might lawfullie withdrawe himselfe
from the hands of his enimies.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The fauourers of frier Pateshull.</p></div>

<p>There were diuerse men of good worship that mainteined this Pateshull, and caused a <span class="xxpn" id="p781">|781|</span>
transcript of this libell to be written foorth, affirming all to be true that was therein mentioned.
Amongst other that thus fauoured this cause, were diuerse knights, as sir William
Neuill, Sir Lewes Clifford, sir Iohn Clanbowe, sir Richard Sturrie, and sir Thomas
Latimer, and the chéefest of all was one sir Iohn Montacute, who caused all the images
to be taken downe and set aside in corners, which Iohn Aubreie, and his successour sir
Alane Buxhull, or any their ancestors had set vp in their chappell of Cheneleie.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ About</span>
the same time, the duke of Ireland sought to be diuorsed from his lawfull wife, a trim
yoong ladie, daughter to the ladie Isabell, that was one of king Edward the third his

reason whereof, great occasion of slander and reproch grew, and diuerse lords, speciallie
the duke of Glocester, that was vncle to the ladie that was forsaken, tooke great displeasure
herewith. But sith the king allowed of all the duke of Irelands dooings, the duke of
Glocester dissembled such iniuries doone to his neece for the time, till opportunitie

<p>The duke of Ireland vnderstood all these things, and therefore was the more circumspect
for his owne safetie, and studied how by some meanes he might dispatch the duke
of Glocester out of the waie, as the man whom he most feared; least his life should be
his destruction, by one meanes or other. Easter was now past, the time (as ye haue
heard) appointed before the which the duke of Ireland should haue transported ouer
into Ireland, &amp; yet was he not set forward. But least somewhat might be thought in the
matter, and for feare of some stir to be raised by the lords of the realme, that wished him
gone, according to the order prescribed at the last parlement, the king as it were to bring
him to the water side, went with him into Wales, where being out of the waie, they might
deuise how to dispatch the duke of Glocester, the earles of Arundell, Warwike, Derbie,
and Notingham, with others of that faction. There were with the king, beside the duke
of Ireland, Michaell de la Poole earle of Suffolke, Robert Trisilian lord chiefe iustice,
and diuers other, which doubtfull of their owne safegards did what they could (as writers
report) to mooue the king forward to the destruction of those noblemen. After the king
had remained in those parties a good while, he returned, and brought the duke of
Ireland backe with him againe so that it seemed his voiage into Ireland was now quite
forgotten.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>About the same time, Robert Trisilian lord chiefe iustice of England came to Couentrie,
and indicted there two thousand persons. The king and the quéene came to Grobie, and
thither came by his commandement the iustices of the realme. There were also with him
at the same time, Alexander archb. of Yorke, Robert Veere duke of Ireland, Michaell
de la Poole earle of Suffolke, Robert Trisilian, &amp; his fellowes; of whom it was demanded,
if by the lawes of the realme the king might reuoke the ordinances made in the last
parlement, to the which he had giuen his consent in manner by constraint; and they
made answer that he might. Then were the iustices commanded to come vnto Notingham,

yet they were constreined to doo as the rest did, among the which was Iohn Belknap, who
vtterlie refused, till the duke of Ireland, and the earle of Suffolke compelled him thereto;
for if he had persisted in the refusall, he had not escaped their hands,
and yet when he <span class="xxpn" id="p782">|782|</span>
had set to his seale, he burst out into these words; “Now (said he) here lacketh nothing
but a rope, that I might receiue a reward worthie for my desert, and I know, if I

made in the last parlement held at Westminster, be hurtfull to the kings prerogatiue.
Wherevnto all of one mind answered, that they were hurtfull, and speciallie bicause they
be against the kings will.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>2 Item, it was inquired of them, how they ought to be punished, that procured the
said statute, ordinance, and commission to be made. Wherevnto with one assent they
answered, that they deserued death, except the king of his grace would pardon
them.</p>

<p>3 Item, it was inquired, how they ought to be punished, which moued the king to consent
to the making of the said statute, ordinance, and commission. Wherevnto they
answered, that vnlesse the king would giue them his pardon, they ought to lose their
liues.</p>

<p>4 Item, it was inquired of them what punishment they deserued, that compelled the
king to the making of that statute, ordinance and commission. Wherevnto they gaue
answer, that they ought to suffer as traitors.</p>

<p>5 Item, it was demanded of them how they ought to be punished that interrupted the
king so, that he might not exercise those things that apperteined to his regalitie and prerogatiue.
Wherevnto answer was made, that they ought to be punished as traitors.</p>

<p>6 Item, it was inquired of them, whether that after the affaires of the realme, and the
cause of the calling togither of the states of the parlement, were once by the kings commandement
declared and opened, and other articles on the kings behalfe limited, vpon
which the lords and commons of the realme ought to intreat and proceed; if the lords
neuertheles would proceed vpon other articles, and not meddle with those articles which
the king had limited, till time the king had answered the articles proponed by them, not­with­stand­ing
the king inioined them to the contrarie: whether in this case the king might
rule the parlement, and cause them to proceed vpon the articles by him limited, before
they proceeded any further? To which question it was answered, that the king should haue
in this part the rule, for order of all such articles to be prosecuted, vntill the end of
the parlement. And if any presumed to go contrarie to this rule, he was to be punished
as a traitor.</p>

<p>7 Item, it was asked, whether the king when soeuer it pleased him might not dissolue
the parlement, and command the lords and commons to depart from thence or not?
Wherevnto it was answered that he might. <span class="xxpn" id="p783">|783|</span></p>

<p>8 Item, it was inquired, that for somuch as it was in the king to remooue such iustices
and officers as offend, and to punish them for their offenses; whether the lords commons
might, without the kings will, impeach the same officers and iustices, vpon their offenses
in parlement or not? To this answer was made, that they might not, and he that attempted
contrarie, was to suffer as a traitor.</p>

<p>9 Item, it was inquired, how he is to be punished, that mooued in the parlement, that
the statute wherin Edward, the sonne of king Edward, great grandfather to the king that
now is, was indicted in parlement, might be sent for; by inspection of which statute, the
said new statute or ordinance and commission were conceiued, and deuised in the parlement?</p>

<p>To which question, with one accord, as in all the residue they answered, that as well he
that so summoned, as the other, which by force of the same motion, brought the said
statute into the parlement house, be as publike offendors and traitors to be punished.</p>

<p>10 Item, it was inquired of them, whether the iudgment giuen in the parlement against
Michaell de la Poole earle of Suffolke, were erronious and reuocable, or not?</p>

<p>To which question likewise with one assent they said, that if the same iudgement were
now to be giuen, the iustices and sergeant aforesaid would not giue the same: bicause it
seemed to them, that the said iudgment is reuocable and erronious in euerie part.</p>

<p>In witnesse of the premisses, the iustices &amp; sergeant aforesaid to these presents haue
set their seals, these being witnesses; Alexander archbishop of Yorke, Robert archbishop

all other iustices of the realme, and the shiriffes. Also, diuerse of the citie of London,
which the king knew would incline to his will, the rather; for that some of them,
hauing aforetime confessed treason against the king by them imagined, and obteining pardon

vnderstand what power of men they might assure the king of, to serue him against the lords
and barons, whome he tooke to be his enimies: and further, that where he meant to call a
parlement verie shortlie, they should so vse the matter, that no knight might be chosen, but
such as the king and his councell should name. But answer was made herevnto by the
shiriffes, that the lords were so highlie beloued of the commons, that it laie not in their
powers to assemble any great forces against the lords; and as for choosing the knights of
the shires, they said that the commons would vndoubtedlie vse their ancient liberties, and
priuileges, in choosing such as they thought meetest. But yet, after that the indictments
were found, according to the desire of the king and his councellors, and that those which
had béene called about this matter, were licenced to depart home; the king and the duke
of Ireland sent messengers into euerie part of the realme, to reteine men of
warre to assist <span class="xxpn" id="p784">|784|</span>
them in the quarell against the lords, if néed were. Manie made answer, that sith they
knew the lords to be faithfull and loiall to the king, euen from the bottome of their hearts,
and were readie to studie, to deuise, and to doo all things that might tend to his honor, and
wealth of the realme; they might not by anie meanes beare armour against them.
But a great number of other, that tooke it that they were reteined for a good and
necessarie purpose, promised to be readie, whensoeuer it should please the king to send for
them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The duke of Glocesters protestation vpon his oth.</p></div>

<p>The lords being in this meane while aduertised of these dooings, were striken with great
heauinesse, for that not knowing themselues (as they tooke it) giltie of anie offense, the
king should thus seeke their destruction. Herewith the duke of Glocester, meaning to
mitigate the kings displeasure, receiued a solemne oth before the bishop of London, and
diuerse other lords, protesting by the same oth, that he neuer imagined, nor went about any
thing, to the kings hinderance, but to his power had alwaies doone what he might to aduance
the kings honor, prosperous state and good liking, except onelie that he had giuen
no good countenance to the duke of Ireland, whom the king so much loued. And suerlie
for that the said duke had dishonored his kinswoman, and the kings also, he was firmelie
determined to reuenge that iniurie vpon him; and herewith he besought the bishop of
London to declare what his words were vnto the king.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Stout words of the bishop of London.</p></div>

<p>The bishop comming to the king, made report of the duke of Glocesters protestation,
confirmed with his oth, in such wise, as the king began somewhat to be persuaded that it
was true. But when the earle of Suffolke perceiued that, fearing least the reconciliation
of the king and the duke his vncle should turne to his vndooing, he began to speake
against the duke, till the bishop bad him hold his peace; and told him, that it nothing
became him to speake at all. And when the earle asked why so; “Bicause (said the
bishop) thou wast in the last parlement condemned for an euill person, and one not worthie
to liue, but onelie it pleaseth the king to shew thée fauour.” The king offended with
the bishops presumptuous words, commanded him to depart &amp; get him home to his church,
who foorthwith departed, and declared to the duke of Glocester what he had heard and
séene. Herevpon, the great misliking that had beene afore time betwixt the king and the
lords, was now more vehementlie increased, the duke of Ireland, the earle of Suffolke, the
archbishop of Yorke, the lord chiefe iustice Robert Trisilian, and others, still procuring,
stirring, and confirming the kings heauie displeasure against the lords.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The lords confer how to preuēt the perils pretended against them.</p>

<p>The earle of North­um­ber­land sent to apprehend the earle of Arundell.</p></div>

<p>The duke of Glocester considering to what conclusion these things tended, came secretlie
to conference with the earles of Arundell, Warwike, and Derbie, who were in like danger,
if they prouided not more spéedilie for their safetie, wherevpon he discouered to them
the perill wherein they all stood in common, so that when they weied what was the most
expedient meane to safe gard their liues, they gathered their power togither, determining
to talke with the king with their armour vpon their backes, for their more suertie, as well
concerning his pretense to bring them to their deaths, as for the fauour which he bare to
those whom they reputed to be traitors, both to him, and to the whole state of the realme,
whereby the same could not auoid spéedie ruine, if remedie were not the sooner prouided.
The king on the other part tooke aduise, how he might apprehend these lords (whom
he tooke to be plaine traitors) ech one apart, before they might gather their strengths about
them; and first, he sent the earle of North­um­ber­land and others, vnto the castell of Reigate,
to take the earle of Arundell, who laie there at that present. But howsoeuer it fortuned,
the earle of North­um­ber­land came backe, and failed to accomplish that which he
had in commandement.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of Arundell ioineth with the other lords.</p></div>

<p>After this, a great number were sent by night, to haue laid hands on him, and to haue
brought him to the kings presence; or in case he resisted, to haue slaine him, if by any
meanes they might: but he being warned by a messenger, that came to him from the duke
of Glocester, conueied himselfe awaie, and with such bands as he had got togither, rode all
that night, so that in the morning hauing passed thirtie miles, not without
great trauell, and <span class="xxpn" id="p785">|785|</span>
all speed possible, he was in the morning aduanced to Haringie parke, where he found the
duke of Glocester, and the earle of Warwike, with a great power of men about them.&#160;
<span class="nowrap">¶ At</span> the same time the king was about to set forward towards Canturburie, there to performe
some vow of pilgrimage, which he had vndertaken to make vnto the shrine of
Thomas Becket. But a brute was raised, and a slander (belike) contriued, to bring him
in further hatred of his subiects, that he meant to steale ouer into France, vnto the French
king, hauing promised to deliuer vp into his hands the towne of Calis, with the castell of
Guines, and all the fortresses which his predecessors had possessed in those parties, either
by right from their ancestors, or by warlike conquest.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Councell taken how to deale against the lords.</p></div>

<p>Howbeit this his iournie to Canturburie was suddenlie staied, vpon knowledge had of
the gathering togither of the lords in Haringie parke, wherewith the king being sore amazed,
called togither such as he trusted, to vnderstand what their opinion was of the matter;
and vnderstanding that the purposed intention of the lords, for which they were so assembled,
was to this end (as they pretended) to bring him vnto a better trade of life, and more
profitable order of gouernement, he was streight striken with no small feare, demanding
of them their aduise, what was best for him to doo in such troublesome state of things.
Some were of this mind, that it should be best to séeke to appease the lords with faire promises,
assuring them, that they should haue their desires. Other thought it better to
assemble the kings friends, and ioining them with the Londoners, to go foorth and trie the
hazard of battell with the lords. Among them that were of this mind, the archbishop of
Yorke was the chiefest. But other that were thought to vnderstand more of the world than
he did, iudged it not wisedome so to doo, considering that if the king lost the field, then
should great harme and dishonor follow; and if the victorie fell to his side, yet could he
gaine naught, but lose a great number of his subiects.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The lords send messengers to the king.</p></div>

<p>This was in Nouember, at what time the king, vpon his returning from Canturburie,
meant to haue holden a parlement; but through those stirs, neither his iournie to Canturburie,
nor the parlement went forward: yet he caused order to be giuen, that no citizen
of London should sell to the duke of Glocester, the earle of Arundell, or any other of the
lords, any armour, bowes, arrowes, or other munition, or matter that might tend to the
furniture of warre, vpon a great paine. But not­with­stand­ing, the lords went forward
with their businesse; and before they approched the citie of London, they sent to the king
the archbishop of Canturburie, the lord Iohn Louell, the lord Cobham, and the lord
Iohn Deuereux, requiring to haue deliuered vnto them such as were about him, that were
traitors and seducers both of him and the realme, that sought nothing else, but to trouble
both poore and rich, and to sow discord and variance betwixt the king and his nobles.
And further, they declared that their comming was for the honor and wealth both of the
king and realme.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A rash answer of the maior of London.</p>

<p>The Londoners refuse to fight against the lords.</p></div>

<p>But the king being ruled altogither by the duke of Ireland, the earle of Suffolke, and
two or three other, was fullie persuaded that the lords intended to bring him vnder their
gouernement, and therfore he was counselled to make the French king his sure friend in
all vrgent necessities. And to be assured of him, it was reported, that those councellors
aduised him to render vp into the French kings hands the towne of Calis, and all that he
had else in possession, on the further side of the sea. Howsoeuer this matter went, truth
it is, that the king sent for the maior of London, requiring to know of him how manie able
men they thought the citie could make. The maior answered, that he thought verely the
citizens might make in time of need, fiftie thousand men, within an houres respit. Well
said the king, then I beseech you go and prooue what will be done. But when the maior
began to attempt the matter, he was answered generallie, that they would neuer fight
against the kings freends, and defenders of the realme (as indeed they tooke the lords to
be) but against the enimies of the king and realme they would alwaies be readie to
fight, and shew what resistance they were able. This answer the maior reported to the
king. <span class="xxpn" id="p786">|786|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of North­um­ber­lands and the lord Bassets
words to the king in the behalfe of the lords.</p></div>

<p>At the same time there was about the king the lord Rafe Basset, who said thus to the
king flatlie and plainelie: “Sir, I haue béene, and euer will be your true liege man, and my
bodie and goods shall euer be at your graces commandement, in all iustice and trueth.
But neuerthelesse, hereof I assure you, that if my hap be to come into the field, I will
without faile alwaies follow the true part; and it is not I that will aduenture to haue my
head broken for the duke of Irelands pleasure.” Likewise, the earle of North­um­ber­land,
being at that time in the court, spake these words to the king; “Sir, there is no doubt
but these lords, who now be in the field, alwaies haue beene your true and faithfull subiects,
and yet are, not intending to attempt anie thing against your state, wealth, &amp; honor.
Neuerthelesse, they féele themselues sore molested and disquieted, by the wicked deuises
of certeine persons about you, that seeke to oppresse them. And verilie without faile,
all your realme is sore greeued therewith, both great and small, as well lords as commons;
and I sée not the contrarie, but they mind to aduenture their liues with the lords
that are thus in armes, speciallie in this case, which they reckon to be yours and your
realmes. And sir, now yée be in the cheefe place of your realme, and in the place of
your coronation, order your selfe now therefore wiselie and like a king. Send to them to
come before your presence in some publike place, where they may declare vnto you the
intent and purpose of their comming, accompanied with so great a number of people
into these parts, and I beléeue it verelie, they will shew such reasons that you will hold
them excused.”<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The lords take an oth togither, to prosecute their purposed enterprise.</p></div>

<p>The archbishop of Canturburie, and the lord chancellor bishop of Elie, and other of the
bishops also there present, affirmed the earles aduise to be good. And the king considering
wiselie the case as it stood, began to be appeased, and accorded to follow their
aduise, desiring the archbishop of Canturburie, and the bishop of Elie, to aduertise them
of his plesure, which was, that he willed them to come to him to Westminster, on sundaie
then next following; and so they repairing to the lords, made report to them of the kings
mind and purpose. But the duke of Glocester, and the other lords, were so fullie bent in
their opinion, that they swore all whole togither, that they would neuer giue ouer their
enterprise, so long as they had a penie to spend, in maintenance of their cause: and if it
chanced anie of them to depart this life, the ouerliuers should persist therein, vntill the
time that they had brought their purpose to some good effect.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The lords séeke the fauour of the Londoners.</p>

<p><i>Thom. Wals.</i></p></div>

<p>And bicause they doubted least the king might stirre the citie of London against them,
they determined first to aduertise the maior and the citie, how their comming was onlie
to reforme certeine great enormities, which they set downe in writing, &amp; sent it to the
maior and citizens, beseeching them of their fauour and counsell therin. This doone, they
determined yet to kéepe their daie on the sundaie following, to appeare before the kings
presence: but this was not got of them, till that the lord chancellor, with diuerse other
noblemen of good credit, had vndertaken vpon their oths for the kings behalfe, that no
fraud nor deceipt, no perill nor euill pretense should be put in practise against the lords,
wherby they might come to losse either of life, limme, or goods, or otherwise, through the
kings means; but that if he should go about anie such things, the said lord chancellor
and other the mediators should forwarne the lords therof.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>An ambush at Mewes.</p></div>

<p>When therefore the lords were readie, according to couenant, to come vnto Westminster,
they were secretlie aduertised, that there was an ambush laid in a place called
the Mewes, and so they staied, and came not at the appointed houre. Wherevpon, when
the king demanded, how it fortuned that the lords kept not promise, the bishop of Elie
lord Chancellor made him this answer; “Bicause” saith he, “there is an ambush of a
thousand armed men or more laid in such a place (and named it) contrarie to couenant,
and therefore they neither come nor hold you for faithfull of your word.” The king hearing
this, was astonied, and said with an oth, that he knew of no such thing, &amp; withall
sent to the shiriffes of London, commanding them to go to the Mewes, and (vpon search
made) if they found anie force of men there assembled, to take and kill all such as they <span class="xxpn" id="p787">|787|</span>
could laie hands vpon. But sir Thomas Triuet, and sir Nitholas Brambre, knight, that
had in déed assembled such a number of men, when they vnderstood what order the king
had giuen therein, they sent their men backe to London.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The lords come before the kings presence in Westminster hall.</p>

<p>The lord chācelor speaketh for the king to the lords.</p></div>

<p>The lords, after this, receiuing a safe conduct from the king, and perceiuing all to be
safe and cleare, came vnto Westminster with a strong power of men about them. The
king, when he heard they were come, apparelled himselfe in his kinglie robes, and with
his scepter in hand came into the great hall at Westminster. The lords as soone as they
had sight of him, made to him their humble obeisance, &amp; went foorth till they came to
the nether steps, going vp to the kings seat of state, where they made their second obeisance;
&amp; then the king gaue them countenance to come néerer to him, &amp; they so did,
kneeling downe before him, &amp; foorthwith he rose from his place, and louinglie welcomming
them, tooke each of them by the hand, and that doone sate him downe againe.
Herewith the bishop of Elie lord chancellor, as mouth to the king, declared vnto these
lords in effect as followeth. “My lords (said he) our souereigne lord the king, hearing
that you were assembled in Haringie parke, in other maner than was conuenient, would
not foorthwith run vpon you with force to destroie you, as he might easilie haue doone,
if he had not wished your safetie; for no man doubteth, but if his pleasure had béene to
gather an armie, he might haue had more people than you could haue got to haue taken
part with you against him, and so happilie much bloud might haue béene spilt, which
thing certeinlie our souereigne lord the king vtterlie abhorreth: and therefore vsing patience
and mildnesse, he hath rather chosen to talke with you in peaceable wise, that he may
vnderstand the cause whie yée haue assembled so great a number of people togither.”<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The answer of the lords &amp; their gréefes.</p>

<p>The king reprooueth the lords dooings.</p></div>

<p>The lords for answer héerevnto said, that “they assembled their forces togither, for
the profit both of the king and realme, and speciallie to take awaie from him such traitors
as remained continuallie about him; to wit, Robert de Veer duke of Ireland, Alexander
Neuill archbishop of Yorke, Michaell de la Poole erle of Suffolke, Robert Trisilian that
false iustice, and sir Nicholas Brambre, that disloiall knight of London: for so they
tearmed them all. And to prooue their accusations true, they threw downe their gloues,
protesting by their oths to prosecute it by battell.” “Naie (saith the king) not so, but in
the next parlement, which we doo appoint before hand to begin the morrow after the
Purification of our ladie, both they and you appearing, shall receiue (according to law)
all that which reason shall appoint. And now to you my lords I speake, by what meane
or by what reason durst you so pre­sump­tu­ous­lie take vpon you within this my land to rise
thus against me? Did you thinke to feare me with such your presumptuous boldnesse?
Haue I not armed men sufficient to haue beaten you downe, compassed about like a sort
of deere in a toil? If I would: trulie in this behalfe I make no more account of you,
than of the vilest skullions in my kitchen.”<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The king taketh both parties into his protection.</p>

<p>When he had said these words, with much more, he lift vp the duke of Glocester that
all this while knéeled afore him, and commanded the residue to rise also. After this
he led them courteouslie to his chamber, where they sate and dranke togither. And
finallie it was concluded, that they should all méet togither againe at the next parlement,
and ech one to receiue according to iustice: and in the meane time the king tooke aswell
the duke of Glocester, as the duke of Ireland into his protection, so that neither part in
the meane time should hurt the other, nor presume to make any gathering of people vntill
the time prefixed: and so this councell brake vp, and the lords departed. These things
yet were doone in absence of the forenamed persons whom the lords accused, for they
durst not appeare in presence of the lords; for if they had béene espied, they had smarted
for it, as was thought, without any respect that would haue béene had of the kings presence.
And now, for somuch as it should be well knowne through all the citie, that these
lords had nothing offended him with their comming, the king caused a proclamation to be
made, the tenour whereof was as followeth. <span class="xxpn" id="p788">|788|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>A proclamation clearing the lords of treason.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">RICHARD
by the grace of God, &amp;c.&#160;&#160; We will that it be knowne to all our liege
people throughout our realme of England, that whereas Thomas duke of Glocester,
Richard earle of Arundell, &amp; Thomas earle of Warwike, haue beene defamed of treason
by certeine of our councellors; we as it apperteineth diligentlie searching the ground &amp;
cause of this defamation, find no such thing in them, nor any suspicion thereof: wherfore
we declare the same defamation to be false, and vntrue, and doo receiue the same duke
and earles into our speciall protection.&#160;&#160; And bicause these accusers shall be notoriouslie
knowne, their names are Alexander archbishop of Yorke, sir Robert Veere duke of Ireland,
Michaell de la Poole earle of Suffolke, Robert Trisilian lord chiefe iustice, and sir
Nicholas Brambre of London knight, who in like case shall remaine till the next parlement
and there shall stand to their answers.&#160;&#160; But in the meane time we likewise take
them into our protection, streictlie charging and commanding, that no maner of person

or cause any hurt to be doone to them, but all quarels &amp; demands against them to be remitted,
vntill the next parlement prefixed.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Now to haue all things in more perfect readinesse and
re­mem­brance when the estates
should be assembled, certeine of the lords were appointed to sit in the meane time, to
deuise how they might procéed orderlie in redresse of such matters, as séemed to require
some spéedie reformation: neither did they thinke it good to depart in sunder, for feare
to be intrapped through the malicious practise of their aduersaries. Which doubt of
theirs seemed afterwards to stand them in stéed of great wisedome. For immediatlie after,
their said aduersaries came to the king, and declared how they were dailie in danger of
their liues, by reason of the malice which the lords had conceiued against them onelie for
the kings sake, and not for any matter of their owne. And whereas the king had promised
that they should appeare at the next parlement, which was at hand, they told him plainelie
that they neither durst nor would put their bodies in such manifest danger. The king
considering hereof, withdrew himselfe from the companie of the lords that were assigned
to sit at London, to deliberate of matters that were to be talked of and ordered in the
parlement; and so that councell was deferred and laid aside: and the kings councellors
that stood in danger of their liues through the malice of the lords confederated with the
duke of Glocester, got them from the court, and withdrew some into this place and some
into that.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of Suffolke fléeth ouer to Calis.</p>

<p><i>Grafton.</i></p></div>

<p>Among other the earle of Suffolke fled ouer vnto Calis in secret wise, by the helpe of a
knight called sir William Hoo, who holpe to conueie him thither. He had changed his
apparell, and shauen his beard, and so disguised, counterfeited himself to be a poulter,
and to sell certeine foule which he had gotten, by which means he was not knowne, till at
length comming to the gates of the castell (wherof his brother sir Edmund de la Poole was
capteine) he discouered to him (scarselie knowing who he was, by reason he was so disguised)
the whole occasion of his repairing thither, requiring him to keepe his counsell,
and that he might remaine with him in priuie maner for a time, till he might heare more
how things went in England, from whence he was thus fled, to auoid the bloudie hands
of his enimies, that sought his life. His brother doubting what might be laid to his
charge if he shuld conceale this matter from the lord William Beauchampe lord deputie
of the towne, streightwaies aduertised him thereof, who tooke order that the earle should
foorthwith be sent backe againe into England to the king, who receiued him with small
thanks to them that brought him ouer, so that (as some write) his brother being one, was
committed to prison for disclosing him. But yet bicause it should not séeme
that he <span class="xxpn" id="p789">|789|</span> imprisoned him for that cause, he was shortlie after set at libertie, and returned againe to his
charge at Calis. The earle was also permitted to go whither he would, although the
king had vndertaken to present him and others at the next parlement to answer their
offenses, as the same might be laid to their charge.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A commission to the shiriffe of Cheshire to safe conduct
the duke of Ireland to the kings presence.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ But</span>
here it may be doubted by the vncertentie of writers, whether the earle of Suffolke
thus fled ouer to Calis, before the iournie at Ratcote bridge, or after. But whether
it chanced either after or before, it is certeine that since the time that the lords had forced
the king to promise to exhibit him and others at the next parlement to abide their trials,
he durst not openlie remaine in the court, but taking leaue of the king departed from
him. Whervpon the king being out of quiet for the absence of him and other his best
beloued councellors, whom he so much esteemed, and namelie of the duke of Ireland, and
the said earle of Suffolke, he appointed one Thomas Molineux constable of the castell of
Chester, a man of high valiancie, and great power in the parties of Cheshire and Lancashire
to raise an armie of men, with the assistance of the shiriffe of Cheshire, to whom
his commission of authoritie in that behalfe, vnder the great seale was directed, to the
end that they might conueie the duke of Ireland in all safetie vnto the kings presence.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">

<p>The shiriffe hauing receiued this commission, togither with the foresaid Thomas Molineux
raised a power, and such as refused to serue, in respect of such good will as they
bare to the lords, he committed to prison, commanding the gailors to kéepe them streict
in irons with bread and water till his returne. Moreuer, the king sent to sir Rafe Vernon,
&amp; sir Richard Ratcliffe, willing them to assist the other. And so thus they set forward
with the number of fiue thousand men. When the lords vnderstood that the duke
of Ireland was marching towards London, with such a power of men, meaning to ioine
with the Londoners, and so to make as it had beene an inuincible armie, they bestirred
themselues, and fell in hand to arme their men, and to exhort one another, that now they
should not be negligent in their owne defense, but make hast for the dispatching of those
that craftilie had gone about to conspire their deaths. And so these lords, to wit, the
duke of Glocester, the earles of Derbie, Arundell, Warwike, and Notingham, assembled
their powers out of all quarters, to incounter with the duke of Ireland; and when they
had got their companies togither, they forelaid all the waies by which he was thought to
come.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

men, supposing that none durst come foorth to withstand him. Neuerthelesse when he
came to Ratcote bridge, not past foure miles from Cheping Norton (which bridge if he
could haue passed, he had béene out of the danger of all enimies) he suddenlie espied
where the armie of the lords laie, not far distant from him, readie in the midst of a vallie to
abide his comming. Some of the earle of Derbies companie had broken the bridge, &amp; so
stopped his passage. He therefore perceiuing his enimies intention, staied, and caused
the kings banner to be spred, and began to set a good countenance of the matter, and to
exhort his people to shew themselues valiant; and herewith caused the trumpets to sound.
But when it appeared that as some were readie to fight in his quarell, so there were other
that quite forsooke him, and said flatlie they would not fight against so manie noble
men, in so vniust a cause: he being thereof aduertised, began to wax faint-harted, and to
prepare himselfe to escape by flight; and declaring no lesse openlie vnto them, said:
“Before we come to ioine, I will séeke to withdraw my selfe out of the waie, and saue
my selfe if I can; for me they onlie seeke, against you they haue no quarell, so that I
being shifted awaie, you shall easilie be preserued.” Herewith one of the knights said to
him; “You haue brought vs out of our countrie, you haue procured vs to giue you our
promise, you haue caused vs to take this iournie in hand: here therefore are we readie to
fight &amp; win the victorie with you, if our hap be such; or if fortune will not so fauour us,
we are readie to spend our liues with you.” “No” said he, “ye shall not so doo,” and <span class="xxpn" id="p790">|790|</span>
forthwith striking his horsse with spurs, he fled from them for feare which had set wings on
héeles, as one saith:<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Thomas Molineux slaine.</p></div>

<p>Herevpon manie that were with him, cursing this his demeanour, prepared to yeeld
themselues to the lords. But Thomas Molineux determined to fight it out, sith the lords
were not yet all come togither to that place, but onelie the earle of Derbie and certeine
others. Neuerthelesse, after he had fought a while, and perceiued it would not auaile
him to tarie longer, as one despairing of the victorie, betooke him likewise to flight, as
the duke of Ireland had led him the waie: and plunging into the riuer, which was at
hand, it chanced that sir Thomas Mortimer being present amongst other at the same
place, willed him to come out of the water vnto him; for if he would not, he threatened
to shoot him through with arrowes in the riuer where he stood. “If I come (said Molineux)
will ye saue my life?” “I will make thée no such promise (said sir Thomas Mortimer)
but not­with­stand­ing, either come vp, or thou shalt presentlie die for it.” “Well
then (said Molineux) if there be no other remedie, suffer me to come vp, and let me trie
with hand-blowes, either with you or some other, and so die like a man.” But as
he came vp, the knight caught him by the helmet, plucked it off his head, &amp; streightwaies
drawing foorth his dagger, stroke him into the braines, and so dispatched him.
This was the end of sir Thomas Molineux, which through his bold and rash aduenture,
in a most dangerous and desperat case, he pulled vpon himselfe; and might as
well haue auoided as incurred, if the same prouident care of safetie had taken him in the
head that mooued the duke of Ireland to take flight for his indemnitie: wherein he séemed
to remember that there is no safe attempting of any perilous enterprise without dread of
danger: for he that can tell when a thing is to be feared, can tell in like sort when it is to
be vndertaken; as the wiseman verie sententiouslie saith:<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The duke of Ireland flieth into Holland.</p></div>

<p>In the meane time, the duke of Ireland (as ye haue heard) séeking to escape by flight,
came to the riuers side; but finding the bridge broken, he galoped till he found an other
bridge, where he found a number of archers readie to stop his passage. When he saw
that he was thus inclosed with his enimies on the one side, and the riuer of Thames on the
other, he thought to put all in aduenture; and casting awaie his gantlets, and sword (to
be the more nimble) gaue his horsse the spurres, and lept into the riuer; but missing the
foord, and not able to land with his horsse on the further side, he forsooke him, and
swimming ouer so well as he might, got to the banke, and so escaped. It was now night,
and therefore his enimies hauing no knowledge of the countrie, followed him not; but his
horsse, helmet, curasses, gantlets, and sword being found, it was thought verelie that he
had béene drowned. The next newes heard of him, was that he had passed the seas, and
was got into Holland, where he had no great freendlie welcome, by reason that Albert duke
of Bauiere, who was lord of that countrie, bare such good will to his coosins of England,
the dukes of Lancaster, Yorke, and Glocester, that he commanded this duke of Ireland
to depart foorth of his countrie, as immediatlie therevpon he did, from thence resorting
to the bishoprike of Vtreict, and after into other countries, till finallie he ended the
course of his life, as after in place conuenient

<p>But now to returne to the armies where we left them. After the duke was fled, and
Thomas Molineux slaine (as before ye haue heard) the armie of the lords set vpon the people
that were come with the duke of Ireland (as hath béene said) foorth of Chesshire, Lancashire,
and Wales; and taking them as enimies, spoiled them of their horsse, armor,
bowes and arrowes. The knights and esquiers had their armor and horsses againe to them
restored, and were reteined with the lords to serue them: but the commons without
either armor or weapon were sent home, and had no other harme done vnto them. The
duke of Irelands cariage being taken, letters were found in his trunkes or males, which
the king had written to him, exhorting him with all spéed to repaire vnto London, with <span class="xxpn" id="p791">|791|</span>
what power he might make, and there he should find him readie to liue and die with him.
Such was the conclusion of this battell, which happened néere vnto Burford, fast by Bablake,
to the great reioising of manie through the realme, for that the enimies thereof (as
they tooke the matter) were thus ouerthrowne. But yet the escaping awaie of the duke
of Ireland did somewhat mitigate their ioy, for what was become of him it was vncerteine.
After this the duke of Glocester, and the other lords went to Oxford, being sorie that their
fortune was not to haue taken the duke of Ireland.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>At the same time, or rather before, the archbishop of Yorke, and the lord chiefe
iustice sir Robert Trisilian, fearing the indignation of the lords, withdrew out of the waie,
and durst not be séene. But now the lords, who after the iournie at Radcote bridge,
were come (as ye haue heard) to Oxford; we find that the same time a brute was raised
(whether of truth or not, we haue neither to affirme nor denie) how there was a messenger
taken being sent from the French king with letters, in which was conteined a licence
of safe conduct, for the king of England, the duke of Ireland, and others, to come to Bullongne,
with a certeine number limited, where they should find the French king come
downe thither readie to receiue them, to the end that for a certeine summe of monie,
which the French king should giue to the king of England, the towne of Calis, and all
the fortresses in those parts, which were in the Englishmens hands, should be deliuered
to the Frenchmen; and further that the king of England should doo his homage to the
French king, for the lands which he held in Gascoigne, and so to haue acknowledged
himselfe his liege man. The lords (as was reported) hauing got these letters, and taken
counsell togither how to procéed in their businesse, to bring the same to good end, remoued
from Oxford, and on Christmas euen they came to S. Albons, and there staied

<p>The lords send to the Maior and citizens of London to vnderstand

<p>The Londoners in great perplexitie which part to take.</p></div>

<p>On saint Stephans daie they tooke their waie to London with an armie of fortie thousand
men, as some write; &amp; comming into the fields besides Clerkenwell, mustered their
men, being diuided in thrée seuerall battels verie well appointed with armor and weapon,
that it was a beautifull sight to behold them. The king kept his Christmas, not at Westminster,
but in the Tower; not douting but there to be defended what chance soeuer
should happen. The lords mistrusting the Londoners, lodged them with their people in
the suburbs. They sent yet two knights, and two esquiers, vnto the Maior and Aldermen
men of the citie, to vnderstand whether they were minded to take part with them, or with
the duke of Ireland, and his adherents, traitors (as they tearmed them) both to the king
and the realme. The Londoners were now in no small feare and perplexitie, not knowing
well what waie was best for them to take, weieng diuers perils; as first the kings displeasure,
if they opened their gates vnto the lords; and if they shut them foorth, they feared
the indignation and wrath of the commons that were come thither with the lords, and
were readie to breake downe their wals and gates, if they were neuer so little prouoked.
Besides this, they stoode most in doubt, least if the wealthiest citizens should not giue
their consent to receiue the lords into the citie, the meaner sort, and such as wished rather
to sée some hurlie burlie than to continue in peace, would séeke by force to set open the
gates, and make waie for the lords and their people to enter, that they might make
hauocke, and spoile whatsoeuer might be found of value in the rich mens houses.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The Londoners incline to the lords.</p>

<p>These doubts with all the circumstances being well weied and considered, the Maior
Nicholas Exton, and certeine of the chiefe men in the citie, went foorth to the lords, and
offered them to lodge in the citie at their pleasure, with all things necessarie as they
should deuise. The Maior caused also wine, ale, bread, and chéese, to be distributed
among the armie, so as ech one had part, which courtesie turned greatlie afterwards to
the commoditie of the citie. The lords vpon search made, perceiuing that there was no
guile meant by laieng of men in ambushes within the citie to intrappe them, or otherwise,
but that all was sure inough and cleare without anie such euill meaning, they entred the
citie and there abode quietlie. Then went the archbishop of Canturburie and others betwixt <span class="xxpn" id="p792">|792|</span>
the king and the lords to make peace betwixt them. But the king at the first seemed
little to estéeme the matter, saieng to the archbishop; Well let them lie here with their
great multitude of people hardlie till they haue spent all they haue, and then I trust they
will returne poore inough and néedie, and then I doubt not but I shall talke with them,
and vse the matter so as iustice maie require.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">

<p>The lords being informed hereof, were maruelouslie mooued, and sware that they
would not depart till they had spoken with him face to face, and foorthwith they sent part
of their companies to watch the Thames, for feare the king should scape their hands, and
then laugh them to scorne. When the king then perceiued himselfe to be inclosed on
ech side, he talked eftsoones with the archbishop and his associats that were messengers
betwixt him and the lords, willing them to declare to the lords that he would be contented
to treat with them in reasonable order; wherevpon they required that he should
on the morow next insuing come vnto Westminster, where he should vnderstand their
demands. When the king heard that, he refused to come vnto Westminster, but willed
that they should come to him there in the Tower. The lords sent him word againe, that
the Tower was a place to be suspected, for that they might there be surprised by some
guilefull practise deuised to intrap them. The king herevnto made answer, that they
might send some two hundred men, or so manie as they should thinke good, to make a
through search, whether they néeded to feare anie such thing; and this accordinglie was
doone: they hauing the keies of the gates and of all the strong chambers, turrets, and

<p>On the fridaie, the duke of Glocester, the earls of Derbie, and Notingham, came to the
king, where he was set in a pauillion richlie arraied; and after their humble salutations
done, and some talke had betwixt them, they went at the kings request with him into his
chamber, where they recited vnto him the conspiracie of their aduersaries, through which
they had béen indicted. They also shewed forth the letters which he had sent to the duke
of Ireland, to leauie an armie vnto their destruction. Likewise the letters, which the
French king had written to him, conteining a safe conduct for him to come into France,
there to confirme things to the diminishing of his honor, to the decaie of his power, &amp;
losse of his fame.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ During</span> the time of this com­mun­i­ca­tion also, the earle of Derbie
desired the king to behold the people that were assembled in sight before the Tower, for
the preseruation of him and his realme: which he did, and maruelling to sée such a goodlie
armie and strength, as he declared to them no lesse, the duke of Glocester said vnto him;

<p>The incōstancie of the king.</p></div>

<p>The king being brought to his wits end, aswell with those things which the lords had
charged him with, as otherwise with the sight of that great multitude of people, seemed
greatlie amazed. Wherevpon the lords, vnder condition that the next daie he should
come to Westminster to heare more of their minds, and to conclude further for the behoofe
of the com­mon-wealth of the realme, began to take leaue of him, meaning so to
depart: but the king desired them to tarrie all night with him and the quéene. The
duke thinking to make all sure, made excuse that he durst not be absent from all those
folks, which they had brought with them, for feare that some disorder might arise, either
in the armie, or in the citie; yet at the kings instance, the earles of Notingham and
Derbie taried there all night. The king before his going to bed, was quite turned concerning
his determination and promise made to go the next daie to Westminster, through
such whispering tales as was put into his eares, by some that were about him, telling him
that it stood neither with his safetie, nor honour, so lightlie to agree to depart from the
tower, vnto such place as the lords had thus appointed him, to serue more for their purpose
than for suertie of his person.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The K. is cōpelled to condescend to the lords request.</p></div>

<p>When the lords therefore vnderstood that he would not keepe promise with them, they
were greatlie offended, insomuch as they sent him flat word, that if he would not come <span class="xxpn" id="p793">|793|</span>
(according to promise) they would suerlie choose another king, that would and ought to
obeie the faithfull counsell of his lords. The king with this message being touched to
quicke, to satisfie their minds, and to auoid further perill, remooued the next morning
vnto Westminster, where the lords comming before his presence, after a little other talke,
they declared vnto him, that aswell in respect of his owne honour, as the commoditie &amp;
wealth of his kingdome, it was behouefull, that such traitors, and most wicked &amp; slanderous
persons, as were nothing profitable, but hurtfull to him and his louing subiects, should be
remooued out of his court; and that other that both could and would serue him more
honorablie and faithfullie were placed in their roomes. The king, although sore against
his mind, when he saw how the lords were bent, and that he wanted power to withstand
their pleasures, condescended to doo what they would haue him.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Certeine persons put out of the court.</p>

<p>Certeine ladies expelled the court.</p></div>

<p>So when he had granted thereto, they iudged that Alexander Neuill archbishop of
Yorke, Iohn Fourdham bishop of Durham lord tresuror, Thomas Rushoke, a frier of the
order of the preachers, bishop of Chichester, and confessor to the king, were worthie to be
auoided the court. But the archbishop of Yorke, and the bishop of Chichester would
abide no reckonings, but got them out of the waie, and fled, it was not knowne whither.
The lords did expell out of the court the lord Zouch of Haringworth, the lord Burnell, the
lord Beaumont, Albrey de Véer, Baldwin de Bereford, Richard Aderburie, Iohn Worth,
Thomas Clifford, and Iohn Louell knights. These were dismissed out of the court, and
remooued from the king, but not discharged, for they were constreined to put in suerties
to appeare at the next parlement. There were also certeine ladies expelled the court, as
those that were thought to doo much harme about the K. to wit, the ladie Poinings, wife
to Iohn Worth of Mowen, and the ladie Moulinge, with others, which also found suerties
to answer at the next parlement, to all such things as might be obiected against them.
Moreouer there were arrested and committed to seuerall prisons, sir Simon Burlie, William
Elmham, Iohn Beauchampe of Holt steward of the kings house, sir Iohn Salisburie,

<p>Shortlie after, to wit, the morrow after the Purification of our ladie, the parlement began,
the which was named the parlement that wrought woonders. The king would gladlie
haue proroged the time of this parlement, if by anie meanes he might. The lords came
to the same parlement, with a sufficient armie for their owne safeties. On the first day
of this parlement, were arrested as they sat in their places, all the iustices (except sir
William Skipworth) as sir Roger Fulthrop, sir Robert Belknap, sir Iohn Carie, sir Iohn
Holt, sir William Brooke, and Iohn Alocton the kings sergeant at law, all which were sent
to the tower, and there kept in seuerall places. The cause whie they were thus apprehended,
was for that, where in the last parlement, diuerse lords were made gouernours of
the realme, both by the assent of the same parlement, and also by the aduise and counsell
of all the iustices then being, and indentures tripartite thereof made, of the which one part
remained with the king, an other with the lords so chosen to gouerne the realme, and the
third part with the iustices: and yet not­with­stand­ing, the said iustices at a councell holden
at Notingham (as yee haue heard before) did go contrarie to that agreement. Wherevpon
it was now determined, that they should make answer to their dooings.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

sir Robert Trisilian lord cheefe iustice of England, to answer Thomas of Woodstoke duke
of Glocester, Richard earle of Arundell, Henrie earle of Derbie, and Thomas earle of
Notingham, vpon certeine articles of high treason, which these lords did charge them with. <span class="xxpn" id="p794">|794|</span>
And forsomuch as none of these appeared, it was ordeined by the whole assent of the parlement,
that they should be banished for euer, and their lands and goods mooueable and
vnmooueable to be forfeit and seized into the kings hands, their lands intailed onelie excepted.
Shortlie after was the lord chéefe iustice, Robert Trisilian found in an apothecaries
house at Westminster, lurking there, to vnderstand by spies dailie what was doone
in the parlement: he was descried by one of his owne men, and so taken and brought to

from thence drawne to Tiburne, and there hanged.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>On the morrow after, sir Nicholas Brambre, that sometime had beene maior of London,
was brought foorth to iudgement and condemned, although he had manie fréends that
made sute to saue his life. This man had doone manie oppressions within the citie of
London (as was reported.) In his maioraltie, he caused great &amp; monstruous stocks to be
made to imprison men therein, and also a common axe to strike off the heads of them
which should resist his will and pleasure, for he was so highlie in the kings fauour, that he
might doo what he would. And the report went, that he had caused eight thousand or
more to be indicted, which before had taken part with the lords, intending to haue put
them all to death, if God had not shortened his daies. Manie other euill fauoured reports
went abroad of him, as that he meant to haue changed the name of London, and to haue
named it little Troie, of which citie baptised with that new name, he purposed to be intituled
duke. But these were forged rumors deuised and spred abroad in those daies, as
manie other were, partlie by the vaine imagination of the people, and partlie of purpose,
to bring those whome the king fauoured further out of the peoples liking. But now
touching sir Nicholas Brambre: in the end being thus called to answer his transgressions,
he was found giltie, and had iudgement, neither to be hanged, nor drawne, but to be beheaded
with his owne axe which before he had deuised: seruing him heerein as Phalaris
the tyrant sometime serued Perillus, the inuentor of that exquisite torment of the brasen
bull, wherein the offendor being put (and the counterfet beast by force of fier made glowing
hot) hauing his toong first cut out, through extreamitie of paine made a bellowing alwaies
as he cried, as if it had béene the verie noise of a naturall bull. Of which strange torment
Perillus himselfe first tasted, suffering death by an engine of his owne deuising,
which he thought should haue purchased him a good liuing, whereof the poet saith:<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>After this, sir Iohn Salisburie, &amp; sir Iames Berneis, both knights and lustie yoong men,
were by iudgement of parlement drawne and hanged. Then folowed Iohn Beauchampe
of the Holt, lord Steward of the kings house, that had serued king Edward the third, and
his sonne Lionell duke of Clarence: who likewise by decrée of this parlement was drawne
and hanged. Also Iohn Blake esquier, who in an infortunate houre stood against the lords
in the councell at Notingham, was now drawne and hanged, and so was one Thomas Vske.
Last of all (or as some hold, first of all) was sir Simon Burlie beheaded, although the earle
of Derbie did what he could to saue his life, by reason whereof, great dissention rose betwixt
the said earle, and the duke of Glocester: for the duke being a sore and a right
seuere man, might not by any meanes be remooued from his opinion and purpose, if he
once resolued vpon any matter. Some spite he bare (as was thought) towards the said sir
Simon Burlie, both as well for the faithfull fréendship, which was growne betwixt the duke
of Ireland, and the said sir Simon, as also for that he looked to haue had such offices and
roomes which sir Simon inioied, by the kings gratious fauour and grants thereof to him
made, as the Wardenship of the cinque ports, and constableship of the castell of Douer
and the office of high chamberleine.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

that when he came to the crowne and was king, he aduanced him highlie to great honours

<p>Neither was there any thing doone concerning the affaires apperteining vnto the state
without his counsell, appointment, and direction, wherein he so much fauoured and leaned
to the partie of the duke of Ireland, that he was sore enuied, and greatlie hated of diuerse
of the rest of the nobilitie, speciallie of the kings vncle the duke of Glocester, who vpon
malice that he bare to the man, not so much for his owne demeanour, as for his alies,
and peraduenture for desire of his roomes, more than of his life, caused him to be accused
of diuerse offenses against the crowne, realme, and church; namelie, for that he had (as
they surmized against him) spoiled and wasted the kings treasure, and withholden the paie
of the souldiers and men of warre, wherevpon he was arrested, called to account, &amp; hauing
no clerke allowed him to make vp the same, was found in arrerages 250000 franks. And
although for one part thereof he demanded allowance of monie, which he had defraied
and laid out in Almaine, and in Boheme, about the kings marriage, and for the residue
desired daies of paiment, yet he could obteine neither. Further, he was accused that the
duke of Ireland and he had gathered great summes of monie, conueied the same to Douer,
and from thence sent it in the night by sea into Germanie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Lastlie, the archbishop (forsooth) and the moonks of Canturburie charged him that he
sought the means to remooue the shrine of the archbishop Thomas, otherwise called
Thomas Becket, from Canturburie vnto Douer, vnder a colour of feare, least the Frenchmen
being assembled in Flanders to inuade England, should land in Kent and take Canturburie,
and spoile it, where indeed (as they surmized against him) he meant to send it
ouer the seas vnto the king of Boheme. Herevpon he was first committed to the tower,
and before the king or his other friends could procure his deliuerance, he was without law
or iustice, before any of the residue (as some hold) brought foorth and beheaded on the
tower hill, by commandement of the duke of Glocester, and other of his faction, quite contrarie
to the kings will or knowledge, in somuch that when he vnderstood it, he spake manie
sore words against the duke, affirming that he was a wicked man, and worthie to be kept
shorter, sith vnder a colour of dooing iustice, he went about to destroie euerie good and
honest man. The king was also offended with the duke of Yorke, for his brothers presumptuous
doings, though the said duke of Yorke being verelie a man of a gentle nature,
wished that the state of the com­mon-wealth might haue béene redressed without losse of
any mans life, or other cruell dealing: but the duke of Glocester, and diuerse other of
the nobilitie, the lesse that they passed for the kings threatening speach, so much more
were they readie to punish all those whom they tooke to be their enimies. In deed the
said sir Simon Burlie was thought to beare himselfe more loftie, by reason of the kings
fauour, than was requisite, which procured him enuie of them, that could not abide others
to be in any condition their equals in authoritie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>It should appeare by Froissard, that he was first of all, in the beginning of these stirs
betwixt the king and the lords, committed to the tower, and not­with­stand­ing all the shift
that either the king, or the duke of Ireland, or anie other of his fréends could make for
him, by the duke of Glocesters commandement he was cruellie beheaded, so
greatlie to <span class="xxpn" id="p796">|796|</span>
the offense of the king, and those that were his trustie councellors, that therevpon the
king caused the duke of Ireland the sooner to assemble an armie against the said duke
and his complices, therby to restraine their presumptuous proceedings. But whether he
was thus at the first or last executed, to please the king the better, now at this parlement,
amongst others that were condemned in the same: his lands were giuen to the king, a
great part whereof he afterwards disposed to diuerse men as he thought expedient. But
yet in the parlement holden in the one and twentith yeare of this kings reigne, the act
of atteindor of the said sir Simon was repealed: and at an other parlement holden in the
second yeare of king Henrie the fourth, all his lands which then remained vngranted and
vnsold, were restored to sir Iohn Burlie knight, sonne and heire of sir Roger Burlie,
brother to the said Simon, of whom lineallie is descended Thomas Eins esquier, now
secretarie to the queenes maiesties councell in the north parts. And thus far touching
sir Simon Burlie, of whom manie reports went of his disloiall dealings towards the state,
as partlie ye haue heard, but how trulie the lord knoweth. Among other slanderous tales
that were spred abroad of him, one was that he consented to the deliuering of Douer
castell by the kings appointment to the Frenchmen for monie. But as this was a thing
not like to be true, so (no doubt) manie things that the persons aforesaid, which were
executed, had béene charged with, at the least by common report among the people,
were nothing true at all; although happilie the substance of those things, for which they
died, might be true in some respect.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

ouerthrew a power of Englishmen, which the earle of North­um­ber­land and his
sonnes had leauied against them. In this battell the earle Dowglas chiefe of that armie
of Scots was slaine, and the lord Henrie Percie, and his brother sir Ralfe, sonnes to the
said earle of North­um­ber­land, were taken prisoners, as in the Scotish chronicles ye may
read more at large. After the feast of the natiuitie of our ladie, a parlement was holden
at Cambridge, in the which diuerse statutes were ordeined; as For the limiting of seruants
wages; For punishment of vagarant persons; For the inhibiting of certeine persons

where the king lodged, by forcing his horsse too much with the spurs, the horsse fell with
him so rudelie to the ground, that his entrails within him were so burst and perished,
that he died the next daie after. Manie reioised at this mans death, as well for that men
iudged him to be excéeding haultie and proud; as also for that he was suspected not to

they got abroad in the countrie. The lord Thomas Mowbraie earle of Notingham was
sent with fiue hundred spears to reuenge those attempts of the enimies: but for that his
power was small in comparison to theirs, he preuailed litle or nothing against them. Sir
Iohn Clanbow, and sir Richard Rouale clerke, tooke the French kings oth; and the earle
of saint Paule that had maried the ladie Maud Courtnie with other noblemen, came into

<p>This yeare the king by counsell of some that were about him, called the nobles and
great men of the realme togither, and as they were set in the councell chamber staieng
till he came: at length he entring into the same chamber, and taking his place to sit
among them, demanded of them, of what age he was now? Whereto answer was made,
that he was full twentie yeares old. Then (said he) I am of yeares sufficient to gouerne
mine owne house and familie, and also my kingdome: for it séemeth aginst reason that
the state of the meanest person within my kingdome should be better than mine. Euerie
heire that is once come to the age of twentie years, is permitted, if his father be not liuing,
to order his businesse himselfe: then that thing which is permitted to euerie other person
of meane degrée by law, why is the same denied vnto me? These words vttered he with
the courage of a prince, not without the instigation and setting on of such as were about
him, whose drift was by dis­count­e­nan­cing others to procure preferment to themselues,
abusing the kings tender years and gréene wit, with ill counsell for their aduantage: where
as it had béene more méete to haue giuen him those precepts which Claudianus hath in

<p>When the barons had hard the words of the king, being therewith astonied, they made
answer, that there should be no right abridged from him, but that he might take vpon <span class="xxpn" id="p799">|799|</span>
him the gouernment as of reason was due. Well said he, yée know that I haue beene a
long time ruled by tutors, so as it hath not béene lawfull to me to doo anie thing, were
it of neuer so small importance, without their consents. Now therefore I will, that they
meddle no further with matters perteining to my gouernment, &amp; after the maner of an
heire come to lawfull age, I will call to my councell such as pleaseth me, and I will deale
in mine owne businesse my selfe. And therefore I will first that the chancellor resigne
to me his seale. When the archbishop of Yorke (who in the yeare last past had béene
remooued from Elie vnto Yorke, and Alexander Neuill displaced) had deliuered vnto
him the seale, the king receiuing it of him, put it in his bosome, and suddenlie rising,
departed foorth of the chamber, &amp; after a little while returning, sat downe againe, and
deliuered the seale to the bishop of Winchester, William Wickham, and so made him
chancellor, although sore against the same bishops will. He made also manie other new
officers, remoouing the old, and vsed in all things his owne discretion and authoritie.
The duke of Glocester, the earle of Warwike, &amp; other honorable and worthie men, were
discharged and put from the councell, and others placed in their roomes, such as pleased

this assuming the regiment to himselfe, as diuerse diuerslie report: so Henrie

at Westminster, and in the feast of the Inuention of the crosse, comming personallie to
the councell house he remooued all the great officers (contrarie to expectation and thinking)
from their offices, and at his pleasure placed in their roomes whome he list. He
remooued the archbishop of Yorke lord chancellor, and put in his place the bishop of
Winchester: he remooued the bishop of Hereford lord treasuror, and put another in his
place: he remooued the clearke of the priuie seale, and all other: so likewise did he the
iustices of either bench. But least the affaires of the realme should in the meane while
be hindered, he commanded the iustices of law to follow and prosecute things requisite
as they were woont, till such time as he was better aduised touching the prouiding of other
iustices. The erle of Arundell likewise, vnto whome the gouernment of the parlement
was committed, and the admeraltie of the sea, was remooued; and the earle of Huntington
put in his roome. In like sort dealt the king with the residue of his officers,
saieng that he ought not to be inferior in degree &amp; of lesse account than an other ordinarie
heire whatsoeuer within the realme of England; sith the law and custome of the realme
of England auerreth, that euerie heire being in the gardianship of anie lord, when he is
growne to be one and twentie yeares of age, ought presentlie to inioy the inheritance left
him by his father, and is lawfullie to possesse his patrimonie, and freelie to dispose and
order his owne goods and chattels to his liking. But now it is come to passe, that I thus
manie yeares haue liued vnder your counsell and gouernement; and now first to God,
secondlie to you, I giue manifold thanks, that you haue gouerned and supported me,
mine inheritance, and my realme of England, as well within as without, &amp; speciallie
against our enimies round about vs, all renowme of honour and praise to vs and our
kingdome alwaies safelie reserued. But now God hath so dealt for vs, that we are of full
age, so that we are two and twentie yeares old at this present: and we require that we
may fréelie and at libertie from this time forward rule and gouerne both our selues and
our inheritance; and we will haue our kingdome in our owne hands, and officers and
seruitors of our owne appointing at our pleasure; secondlie, as shall seeme to vs more
auaileable, by Gods grace, to elect, choose, and preferre vnto offices such as we doo
well like of, and at our pleasure to remooue such as be presentlie resiant, and in their
roomes to substitute and set others wheresoeuer and whomsoeuer we list. The king
hauing thus spoken, there was not one that went about to breake him of his will, but

to preach the word, and to dispense the sacraments. This they did in secret: but they
were discouered by one that had beene of their fellowship, who declared to the bishop of
Salisburie at his manor of Sonning, all the whole circumstances thereof, as he knew.
There were of them that preached in those daies earnestlie against pilgrimages, calling
such images as the people had in most veneration, as that at Walsingham, and the rood
of the north doore at Paules in London, rotten stocks, and worme eaten blocks, through
which the vnskilfull people being mocked and deceiued, were compelled most manifestlie
to commit idolatrie. The bishops (saith Thomas Walsingham) hearing, beholding, and
knowing these things with much more, to be true, did little or nothing to redresse the
same, saue onlie the bishop of Norwich who stirred coles, swearing and staring, that if
anie of that sect presumed to preach anie peruerse doctrine within his diocesse, he would

knew that the king would shew no good countenance to some of the noblemen; and
therefore he doubted least malicious offenses might arise betwixt them, which to appease

<p class="pfirst">This
Henrie had by Ada his wife, his sonne &amp; heire Henrie Hastings, from whome Buchanan
dooth saie that Henrie Hastings now earle of Penbroke is descended, whereof I
will not now heere dispute.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Henrie Hastings knight, sonne of Henrie, after the death of his father, finding himselfe
greeued that the inheritance, which should haue descended vnto him from his mother,
was so withholden from him for the offense of his father, contrarie to law and iustice,
and without iudgement, but by the kings power, pursued a bill against the king, therby
to haue remedie and restitution, for the supposed false returne of the extent which was
made against his father; and vpon the same bill, this Henrie Hastings obteined a new
writ to make a fresh extent directed to maister Thomas of Wimundham, Robert de la
Laie, Robert de Solham, Hugh Peeche, &amp; Thomas de Braie, to vnderstand if the remnant
of the lands to him descended, beside that by the king extended, would counteruaile
the value of such lands as he should haue by descent from and of the earle and earledome
of Chester, which matter neuer being ended in his time, was afterward prosecuted
of the Hastings from parlement to parlement, vntil the thirtie fourth yeare of Edward the
first, as more plainelie shall after appeare. Of this Henrie, Hollingshed intreateth much
in the reigne of Henrie the third: this man (being he that in the time of Edward the first,
made title to the crowne of Scotland) maried Ione one of the daughters of William Cantulpe
lord of Aburgauenie, in the right of Eua, one of the daughters and heires of William
Bewsa or Brewcusa, for I find both written, of which Ione this Henrie had issue Iohn
Hastings his sonne and heire, Edmund which maried Isabell, &amp; had great possessions in
Wales: Ada first maried to Robert de Champane: Lora maried to sir Thomas the sonne
of sir Iohn de Latimer, and Ione which was a nun at Nottingham.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Iohn Hastings knight, sonne of the last Henrie, was borne at Asleghe, in the yéere of
our Lord 1262, and in the six &amp; fortith yeare of the reigne of Henrie the third. This
man after his fathers death did (in the yeare of our Lord 1274, and the second yeare of
the reigne of Edward the first, being the kings ward) demand the execution of his office
of the pantrie, at the coronation of queene Elianor wife to Edward the first, but could not
execute the same by reason of his nonage, and also for that he was in ward to the said
king. After, when he was growne to full yeares, there arose in the yeare of our Lord
1305, and in the thirtie third yeare of the reigne of Edward the first, great contention
betweene Antonie Beake bishop of Durham, this Iohn Hastings, Iohn Balioll, and Robert
Bruse, for the manors of Penrith, Castlesoure, Salgkill regis, Lange Worthbie,
Carlaton, and of Werkine Tinehale, whereof Henrie king of Scots (kinsman of the said
Robert Bruse, Iohn Balioll, and Iohn Hastings, whose heire they were) died seized in
his demesne of fee. In which sutes after manie delaies made,
and manie summons <span class="xxpn" id="p803">|803|</span>
against the said bishop, the plée went without daie, bicause the bishop must go to Rome.
But after his returne the sute being reuiued and continued, it went once more without
daie, bicause the king seized the same into his hands, and held it all the time of his reigne.
These things thus doone, and Edward the first departed, this Iohn Hastings as yet not
hastie to renew his sute of the land, but rather to execute his right of the pantrie, did in the
first yeare of Edward the second, demand the executing of that office, at the coronation
of the said Edward the second and Isabell his wife at Westminster, which he obteined,
and laid the clothes and napkins in the great hall by him and other his knights, one the
tables whereat the king, the quéene, and other great states should dine, which (according
as I haue seene noted) was in this sort.</p>

<p>Which petitions and all other petitions for his part of his land in the kings hands, by
the censure made in the time of Henrie the 3, the said Iohn Hastings lord of Aburgauennie
did pursue from parlement to parlement, vntill the parlement holden at Yorke after
Michaelmas, where supplication was made to the king, by him and others, that he might remaine
with the king in Gascoigne, as his steward or marshall: which if he would performe,
all his forsaid petitions and all other petitions which were reasonable, should be granted vnto
him. By occasion whereof he granted vnto the kings and the nobles request: so that the king
would find him pledges due therefore, and that he might obteine iustice in his inheritances,
and those his lawfull sutes, which had beene hitherto denied vnto him, which
thing the king faithfullie promised in euerie respect to be performed
towards him: <span class="xxpn" id="p804">|804|</span>
wherevpon he sailed into Gascoigne, in the yeare of Christ 1302, being the 31 of Edward the
first, the wednesdaie after the feast of S. Lucie. But for this faire shew, it séemeth he
sped neuer the better: for which cause not being restored in the 34 yeare of Edward the
first, he pursued his sute afresh, and had from the king at Yorke this definitiue sentence,
deliuered by the mouth of Walter Langhton, then the kings treasuror (as I find by such
notes as I haue séene) that he should séeke the records of the chancerie, and bring them to
the next parlement, which the said Iohn did. At what time he brought foorth the former
grant of Henrie the third, of the said lands giuen in recompense of his part of the earledome
of Chester. After which yet it was agréed by the king and his councell for diuerse
con­si­der­a­tions (and mostlie (as I suppose) because he had refused to serue in Gascoigne,
and onelie went as it were inforced) not­with­stand­ing all that the said Iohn could alledge,
that he should take nothing for his petition, but further to be in the kings mercie for his
false claime: the whole processe whereof I haue seene in an ancient written monument
of French. All which (as I gather) was done in the life of Edward the first (not­with­stand­ing
that I haue a little vnorderlie before treated of the executing of his office of the
pantrie at the coronation of Edward the second, sonne to Edward the first) as may be
confirmed by Piers Longtoft in these verses:</p>

<p>This Iohn married two wiues both called Isabell, whereof the first was Isabell
de Valence one of the daughters and heirs of William Valence earle of Penbroke
&amp; lord of Aburgauennie, but how the said Wil. Valence came to the honor of
Aburgauennie, since William Cantelupe before named was once lord thereof, and
much about that time, I can not yet certeinlie learne. But yet I following good
authoritie haue set downe this Valence to be lord of Aburgauennie, &amp; that he gaue
the same to one Iohn Hastings, which must néeds be this man, marieng his daughter.
The other wife of this Iohn Hastings, was Isabell the daughter of Hugh Spenser earle of
Winchester. By his first wife he had six children, to wit, Iohn Hastings his heire, William
Hastings that maried Elianor the daughter of sir William Martin, which died without
heires; Henrie Hastings that was a clerke, and Elizabeth Hastings maried to Roger
Greie lord of Ruthine sonne of sir Iohn Greie, of whom is descended Henrie earle of
Kent now liuing. Ione maried to Edmund Mortimer, by whom she had no issue, being
after maried to William de Huntingfield, by whome she had Roger de Huntingfield; and
Margaret Hastings maried to William the sonne of William Martin lord of Kemmies. By
Isabell Spenser his second wife, he had thrée children, to wit, Hugh Hastings lord of
Folliot, of whome shall be more intreated, when we come to the last Iohn Hastings erle
of Penbroke slaine at tilt, as before. Thomas Hastings, and Pelagia de Huntington.
His first wife Isabell Valence died 1305, being the 31 of Edward the first, and was buried
at the frier minors in Couentrie. His second wife ouerliuing hir husband, was after
maried to sir Rafe Monthermer, for which mariage the said Rafe was fined by Edward the
second at a thousand marks, as appeareth in the rols of the chancerie of 13 of Edward
the second: she died the 9 of Edward the third, &amp; was buried in the frier minors of Salisburie.
This Iohn Hastings departed this life 1313, the sixt yeare of the reigne of Edward
the second.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Iohn Hastings lord Hastings and Aburgauennie, was borne in the fiftéenth yeare of
Edward the first, in the yeare of Christ 1287. For at the death of his father, which happened
(as before) in the sixt yeare of Edward the second, he was found to be of the age of
six &amp; twentie years, which if it be added to the yeare of our Lord 1287, make vp the full
number of 1313, in which his father died. This man in the eight yeare of Edward the
second at the parlement holden at London in the Carmelite friers, being about the yeare <span class="xxpn" id="p805">|805|</span>
from the birth of Christ 1314, renewing the sute to the king (after the death of Antonie
Beke bishop of Durham, which happened in the yeare of our Lord 1310) for the lands,
whereof his father had the said bishop in sute, and which were after seized into the kings
hands, as before appeareth, in the life of his father. It was then found vpon search, that
sir Iohn Ballioll (who was partie to the said sute before) had the realme of Scotland by
award: by reason of certeine lands that he gaue to sir Antonie de Beke the bishop of
Durham: for which cause it séemed king Edward the first seized the same lands into his
hands as forfeit to him, in that they were after the maner of a bribe giuen to the said
bishop, to support the sute of the said Iohn Balioll for the obteining of the crowne of
Scotland. And for that cause this Iohn Hastings was counselled by such as willed him
well, that he should surceasse his sute, and so he did. This Iohn Hastings maried Iulian
the daughter of Thomas lord Leiburne the sonne of William lord Leiburne, and had by
hir Laurence de Hastings: after which this Iohn Hastings died in the eightéenth yeare
of Edward the second, and in the yeare of our Lord 1325. His wife Iulian liued manie
yeers after, and surrendred hir life in the fortie one yeare of Edward the third, and in the
yeare of our Lord 1366.</p>

<p>Laurence Hastings lord Hastings and Aburgauennie, was also afterward earle of Penbroke,
he was borne about the thirtéenth yeare of Edward the second, being also about
the yeare of our redemption 1320: which is proued by this, that the said Laurence was
fiue yeares old at the death of his father, which (as before is said) happened in the yeare
1325, and in the eightéenth of Edward the second, at what time he was seized as the
kings ward, and committed to the gouernement of tutors, appointed him by the said Edward
the second. This Laurence Hastings for the nobilitie of his race, the actiuitie of
him selfe, the largenesse of his possessions, and his familiaritie with the king, was
created earle of Penbroke, about the one and thirtith yeare of the reigne of king Edward
the third. He maried Anne or Agnes the third daughter of sir Roger Mortimer the first
earle of March, by whom he had issue Iohn Hastings.</p>

<p>Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke lord Hastings Aburgauennie and Weifford in Ireland,
the sonne of Laurence Hastings the first earle of Penbroke of that name, did in the fortie
one yeare of Edward the third, being about the yeare of our Lord 1369, infeoffe diuerse
persons of the manor of Lidgate in Suffolke, of which towne was Iohn Lidgate the monke
of Berie and famous poet of England surnamed. After which in the fortie six yeare of
Edward the third, and in the yeare of our Lord 1371, when the Frenchmen besieged
Rochell, he was sent with an armie of men to the rescue of the same. But being set
vpon by the Spanish nauie in the hauen of Rochell, they slue and tooke manie of the
English, burnt their nauie, and caried the earle with sundrie other prisoners into Spaine;
where this earle a long time remained prisoner. Which misfortune was iustlie supposed
to haue fallen vpon him, because he was a man of euill life, giuen greatlie to lecherie, an
infringer of the liberties of the church, and a persuader of the king that he should (for
his warres) more grieuouslie exact manie subsidies and contributions vpon the clergie
than vpon the laitie. After that he had béene long prisoner in Spaine (by the space
almost of three yeares) he was ransomed for a great summe of monie, by Bertram Cleikine,
and died (as I coniecture by some sufficient proofe) betwéene Paris and Calis, as
he came into England, in the fortie ninth yeare of Edward the third, in the yeare of our
Lord 1374: so that he neuer fullie paied his ransome. He had two wiues, Margaret the
daughter of Edward the third, &amp; Anne the daughter of sir Walter Mannie and of Margaret
Segraue made dutchesse of Northfolke in the time of Richard the second: but when
he maried these wiues, I can not certeinlie find. And in the earle of Kents booke
(which treateth of the contention of the Hastings and the Greies, for bearing of the
armes of Hastings) there is no mention made (as farre as my memorie serueth) of the
said Margaret; the reason whereof I suppose to be, for that this Iohn Hastings had no
issue by hir: and that booke onelie serued to conueie a lineall descent from the Hastings <span class="xxpn" id="p806">|806|</span>
to intitle the Greies. This Iohn Hastings had by his second wife (Anne) a sonne called
Iohn Hastings, which after succéeded his father in all his inheritances.</p>

<p>But before I saie anie more of the Hastings, I thinke it not amisse to giue some warning
of an error in Polydor of Vrbin, writing that Anne the countesse of Penbroke (wife to
this man, for none of the earles of Penbrokes had anie wife so named within the compasse
of years wherein Polydor appointeth this time) descended of a noble house of S. Paule in
France, a woman of great vertue, and a louer of learning and of learned men, founded a
house in Cambridge, to this daie called Penbroke hall: which in truth was not builded by
hir, but by Marie the wife of Odomare or Aimer de Valence earle of Penbroke, who was
slaine at tilt in the one &amp; twentie yeare of Edward the third, in the yeare of our Lord
1374: which was thirtie seauen yeares before the death of this Iohn Hastings earle of
Penbroke: which Marie was in verie déede the daughter of Guie earle of S. Paule, the
kinswoman of Edward the third, and a French woman. This woman being in one daie
(&amp; that the daie of hir mariage) a maid, a wife, &amp; a widow (hir husband being that
day slaine at tilt) did in hir widowhood (in the one &amp; twentith yeare of Edward the 3, in
the yeare of our Lord 1374) erect that house in Cambridge vpon hir owne ground, and
appointed the same to be called the hall of Marie Valence, or Penbroke hall: by meanes
whereof it was long after called Aula Valentiæ Mariæ.</p>

<p>Now to returne (where I left) to the last wife of this Iohn Hastings called Anne, she
(after the death of hir husband) did at the coronation of Richard the second, in the yeare
of Christ 1382, being about the fift yeare of the reigne of the said Richard, sue by petition
to execute by hir deputie the office of the panteler, by reason of the manor of Ashley, which
she had for hir iointure, whervnto she was admitted, &amp; by hir deputie sir Thomas Blunt
knight did performe the same: as this record dooth testifie, in which is set both hir petitions,

<p class="pcontinue">Thus
this much touching this Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke and dame Anne Mannie
his wife.</p>

<p>Iohn Hastings (the sonne of Iohn Hastings last recited) was earle of Penbroke lord
Hastings Aburgauennie &amp; Weisford, who being verie yoong at the time of his fathers death,
was ward first to Edward the third, and then to Richard the second, but neuer saw his
full age of one and twentie yeares, nor euer possessed the lands wherevnto he was borne:
for not long after that he had married Philip the second daughter of Edmund Mortimer
(earle of March Vlster and lord of Wigmore) he was [about the
ninetenth yeare of his age, <span class="xxpn" id="p807">|807|</span>
the fiftéenth yeare of king Richard the second, and the yeare of our redemption 1391,
being a youthfull and lustie yoong gentleman (but tender and slender) in the Christmasse
time, when the K. held that feast at Woodstoke in Oxfordshire] willing to learne to iust,
whervpon in the parke then incountring with a knight called Iohn saint Iohn (a valiant
and stout person) he was slaine when they ran togither, as the said knight did cast his
speare from him, and so the said earle receiuing this manner of death, no man knew whether
it happened by mishap or of purpose. To which Iohn Hastings now slaine, Margaret
Segraue duchesse of Northfolke his grandmother (by his mother the daughter of sir Walter
Mannie) was executrix and disposer of all his substance. After his death, his widow the
ladie Philip was married to Richard earle of Arundell, &amp; after that to Iohn lord saint
Iohn, being the same man (as I suppose) which slue hir first husband this Iohn Hastings.
But here before the death of this Iohn I must not forget, that though he were within age
at the coronation of Richard the second, as not being past nine or ten yeares old; he sued
to execute at the said coronation, the offices which his ancestors had afore performed.
But bicause his mother had the mannor of Ashley in dower (as is before expressed) he
did not sue to serue in the pantrie, but leauing that, demandeth the carieng of the second
sword and the golden spurs before the king. The records of both which I haue here set

<p>In this Iohn Hastings ended all the honorable titles of the Hastings, bicause this man
dieng without issue, his inheritances were dispersed to diuerse persons; for the honour of
Penbroke came to Francis at court by the kings gift, the baronies of Hastings and Weisford
came to Reinold Greie of Ruthine, the baronie of Aburgauennie was granted to
William Beauchampe of Bedford: for all which lands, and for the bearing of the armes
of this same Iohn Hastings without difference, great contention grew betwéene sir Edward
Hastings knight (descended of Isabell Spenser) and Reinold Greie lord Greie of Ruthine,
sonne of Reinold Greie, sonne of Roger Greie, that married Elizabeth daughter of Isabell
Valence, for both the said lord Greie and sir Edward Hastings were descended by two
venters (as partlie before and partlie hereafter shalbe shewed) from one man Iohn Hastings,
husband to both said Isabels. For the explanation whereof, and lineall descent to
conueie the said sir Edward Hastings from the said sir Iohn Hastings, first lord of Aburgauennie
of that surname; I must here repeat a little of that which I haue alreadie written:
which is, that the said Iohn Hastings first lord of Aburgauennie, hauing two wiues,
both Isabels, by his first wife Isabell Valence had Elizabeth maried to Roger Greie, and
by his second wife Isabell Spenser, he had issue Hugh Hastings knight, from whome we
are to deduce the said sir Edward Hastings in this sort. Hugh Hastings knight lord of
Folliot (in the right of his wife) being sonne of the second wombe of Isabell Spenser, and
Iohn Hastings sonne of Henrie Hastings married Margerie the daughter and heire of sir
Richard Folliot, by whom he came to be lord of Folliot, and alwaies bare the armes of
Hastings with a difference of a second brother of a second venter. This marriage was
procured and made by Isabell his mother, who purchased the said ward for him. This
Hugh died in the yeare of Christ 1347, in the one and twentith yeare of Edward the
third, and was buried in the church of Elsing, in Elsrug in Northfolke which he
builded; his wife Margerie died in the yeare 1349, being the thrée and twentith yeare
of Edward the third, and was buried in the chappell of Fornewell. This Hugh had
issue by his wife Hugh Hastings his heire, and a daughter married to sir Robert de la
Mare.</p>

<p>Hugh Hastings knight, the sonne of Hugh and Margerie Folliot did marrie the daughter
of Adam de Eueringham, by whom he had Hugh Hastings his sonne and heire, and two
daughters, the one married to Winkfield, and the other to a knight called Elmham. This
Hugh died at Calkewelhell or Gwines, and was buried in the friers of Doncaster, in the
yeare of our Lord 1369, about the foure &amp; fortith yéere of Edward the third. This man
for him and his heires in difference from the other Hastings, earles of Penbroke his kinsmen
by the halfe blood, did beare the Hastings armes with the labell, quartered with the armes
of Folliot. Hugh Hastings knight the sonne of Hugh and Margaret Eueringham married
Anne the daughter of Edward Spenser earle of Glocester, by whom he had issue Hugh
Hastings and Edward Hastings, which contended with Reinold Greie lord of Ruthine.
This Hugh tooke his pilgrimage to Ierusalem &amp; died in Spaine, after whose death dame
Anne Spenser his wife was maried to Thomas lord Morleie. Hugh Hastings eldest son
of Hugh Hastings and dame Anne Spenser, married the daughter of sir Wil. Blunt
knight; this Hugh died at Calis at the mariage of Richard the second, to Isabell the
daughter of the king of France, about the 19 yeare of the reigne of the said Richard, being
the yeare of our redemption 1395, who dieng without issue, all his right and title came to his
brother Edward. <span class="xxpn" id="p809">|809|</span></p>

<p>Edward Hastings knight brother of the last Hugh began the contention with Reinold
Greie lord of Ruthine, for the right of the lands, honors, and armes without difference of
the last Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke. This sute began about the eight yeare of
Henrie the fourth, and continued at least vntill the fift yeare of Henrie the fift, if not
longer; but in the end (not­with­stand­ing manie false pedegrees counterfeited by this
Hastings, and his vncle Henrie bishop of Norwich, one of the house of the Spensers) yet it
was adiudged against the said sir Edward Hastings in the marshals court, that the lands,
honors, and armes without difference, as the last Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke did
beare them, with the armes of William Valence earle of Penbroke, should be onelie borne
by the said lord Greie of Ruthine and his heires, as being of the whole blood, and next
heire to the said last Iohn Hastings earle of Penbroke, and that the said Edward Hastings
should vtterlie be barred to beare the armes of Hastings, but quartered with the armes of
Folliott, as onelie descending of the halfe blood of the said last earle of Penbroke of that
name. And that all other pedegrees what so euer (except this) are false, and of purpose
contriued, as appeareth by a notable booke and monument thereof remaining in the hands
of Henrie Greie now earle of Kent (descended of the said Reinold Greie of Ruthine)
conteining all the processe, examinations, witnesses, pedegrees &amp; iudgements thereof,
more plainelie maie appeare. In which contention there was shewed a matter by the
deposition of sir William Hoo knight not vnworthie to be remembred (though it touch
not the Hastings) concerning armorie and bearing of differences in armes, which was,
that the said sir William said on his oth in the tenth yeare of Henrie the fourth, that before
the times of Edward the third, the labell of three points was the different appropriat and
appurtenant for the cognizance of the next heire; but the same king made his sons to
beare the entire armes with labels of thrée points, with certeine differences in the said
labels, to be knowen the one from the other, except his sonne the duke of Glocester, who
bare a border about the armes of France and England. And thus, this much Francis Thin

<p>In this yeare Thomas earle of Lancaster, for the opinion which had béene conceiued of
him, by reason of miracles and other respects, was canonized for a saint. The mondaie
next after the feast of saint Hilarie, a parlement was begun at Westminster, in which there
was a bill exhibited by the commons, that the lords and great men of the realme should
not giue to their men badges to weare as their cognizances; by reason that through the
abuse thereof, manie great oppressions, imbraseries, vnlawfull maintenances, and wrongs
were practised, to the hinderance of all good orders, lawes, and iustice. The lords would
not consent altogither to laie downe their badges; but yet they agreed that none should
weare any such cognizance except their seruants of houshold, and such as were in ordinarie
wages by the yeare.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ In</span> the same parlement, certeine persons that had gone about some
new rebellion in Kent, being apprehended, were condemned, and so were drawne and
hanged.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ There</span> was also an act made against such as should passe the seas, to purchase
prouisions (as they termed them) in any church or churches. And if any from thencefoorth
attempted so to doo, he should be reputed and taken as a rebell. Also there was
an act prouided against those that committed any wilfull murder, that none should presume
to sue for their pardon. A duke or an archbishop that so sued, should forfeit to the
king an hundred pounds. Likewise an earle or a bishop, an hundred marks, &amp;c.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

of the treasurors, towards the bearing forth of the charges of wars when any chanced. ¶
Also there was a subsidie granted of six pence in the pound, foure pence to the vse last
mentioned, and two pence to be imploied at the kings pleasure. In the same parlement,
Iohn duke of Lancaster was created duke of Aquitaine, receiuing at the kings hand the
rod and cap, as inuestures of that dignitie. Also the duke of Yorke his sonne and heire <span class="xxpn" id="p810">|810|</span>
was created earle of Rutland. In the fift of March a sore and terrible wind rose, with
the violence whereof, much hurt was doone, houses ouerthrowne, cattell destroied, and

<p>In this thirtéenth yeare of king Richards reigne, the christians tooke in hand a iournie
against the Saracens of Barbarie, through sute of the Genowais, so that there went a
great number of lords, knights, and gentlemen of France and England, the duke of
Burbon being their generall. Out of England there went one Iohn de Beaufort bastard
son to the duke of Lancaster (as Froissard hath noted) also sir Iohn Russell, sir Iohn
Butler and others. They set forward in the latter end of this thirtéenth yeare, and came
to Genoa, where they remained not long, but that the gallies and other vessels of the
Genowais were readie to passe them ouer into Barbarie. And so about Midsummer in
the beginning of the fourteenth yeare of this kings reigne, the whole armie being embarked,
sailed foorth to the coasts of Barbarie, where neare to the citie of Affrike they landed, at
which instant the English archers (as some write) stood all the companie in good stead,
with their long bowes, beating backe the enimies from the shore, which came downe to

<p>After they had got to land, they inuironed the citie of Affrike, (called by the moores
Mahemedia) with a strong siege: but at length constrained with the intemperancie of the
scalding aire in that hot countrie, bréeding in the armie sundrie diseases, they fell to a composition
vpon certeine articles to be performed in the behalfe of the Saracens, and so 61
daies after their first arriuall there, they tooke the seas againe, &amp; returned home, as in the
histories of France and Italie is likewise expressed. Where, by Polydor Virgil it may
séeme, that the lord Henrie of Lancaster earle of Derbie, should be capteine of the English
men, that (as before ye haue heard) went into Barbarie with the Frenchmen, and
Genowais. It should otherwise appeare by other writers, who affirme that the said earle
made a iournie in deed the same time against the miscreants, not into Barbarie, but into
Prutzenland, where he shewed good proofe of his noble and valiant courage: for ioining
with the masters and knights of the Dutch order there, the armie of the Lithuanians
that came against the said order was vanquished, and foure chiefe leaders of the Lithuanians
were taken prisoners, thrée other being slaine, with thrée hundred of their chiefest
and best approoued soldiers. Through the policie also and worthie manhood of the
earle of Derbie, there was a certeine citie taken, where the said earle and his men first
entring vpon the walles, did set vp his banner: other being slouthfull, or at the least
vnskilfull how to deale in such exploits. There were taken and slaine foure thousand of
the common people, and amongst them that were found dead, the king of Polognies
brother was one. The castell of the same citie was besieged fiue weekes space: but by
reason of sickenesse and such infirmities as chanced in the armie, the masters of Prutzen,
and Lifeland would not tarie any longer, but breake vp their siege and returned. The
master of Lifeland led with him into his countrie thrée thousand prisoners.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>In the meane time, whilest the christians were thus occupied, as well against the infidels
Barbarie, as in the east parts towards Littawe, a roiall iusts and martiall turnament
was proclaimed to be holden within Smithfield in London, to begin on sundaie
next after <span class="xxpn" id="p811">|811|</span>
the feast of saint Michaell. And bicause this triumphant pastime was published, not onelie
in England, but also in Scotland, in Almaine, in Flanders, in Brabant, in Heinault, &amp;
in France, manie strangers came hither foorth of diuerse countries, namelie Valeran erle
of saint Paule, that had married king Richards sister the ladie Mauld de Courtnie, and
William the yoong erle of Osteruant, sonne to Albert de Bauiere earle of Holland and
Heinault.
At the daie appointed, when all things were prepared there issued foorth of
the tower about thrée of the clocke in the after noone sixtie coursers apparelled for the
iustes, and vpon euerie one an esquier of honor, riding a soft pace. Then came foorth
foure and twentie ladies of honour (three score saith Froissard) mounted on palfries,
riding on the one side richlie apparelled, and euerie ladie led a knight with a chaine of
gold.
Those knights being on the kings part, had their armor and apparell garnished
with white hearts and crownes of gold about their necks, and so they came riding through
the stréets of London vnto Smithfield, with a great number of trumpets and other instruments
before them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

the place, they were taken downe from their palfries, and went vp into chambers readie prepared
for them. Then alighted the esquires of honor from their coursers, &amp; the knights
in good order mounted vpon them. And so when their helmets were set on their heads,
and that they were redie in all points, after proclamations made by the heraults, the iusts
began, and manie commendable courses were run, to the great pleasure, comfort, and
recreation of the king, the quéene, and all other the beholders. The prise that daie on the
answerers part was giuen to the earle of saint Paule; and on the chalengers side, to the
earle of Huntington. On the mondaie, the king himselfe, with dukes, earls, lords, and
knights, came to the iusts, he being cheefe of the inner part. That daie the prise was
giuen to the erle of Osteruant, for the best dooer of the vtter part: and of the inner part,
to a knight of England called sir Hugh Spenser. On the tuesdaie, all manner of esquiers
iusted, and likewise on the wednesday all maner of knights and esquires that would, on
which daie was a sore and rude iusts, enduring till night. And so manie a noble course
and other martiall feats were atchiued in those foure daies, to the great contentation and
pleasure of manie a yoong batcheler desirous to win fame, &amp; also highlie to the kings
honour, who by all that season held his court in the bishops palace by Paules church,
kéeping open houshold for all honest persons that thither resorted, especiallie euerie
night after the iusts were ended, a right sumptuous and princelie supper was prepared
for the strangers and other, and after supper, the time was spent in dansing and reuelling
after the most courtlike maner. On the thursdaie, the king made a supper to all
the lords, knights, and gentlemen strangers, and the quéene to all the ladies and gentlewomen.
On the fridaie the duke of Lancaster feasted at dinner all the said lords,
knights, and gentlemen strangers, in most sumptuous and plentifull maner. On the
saturdaie, the king and all the whole companie departed from London vnto Windsore,
where new feasting began, and speciallie the king did all the honour that might be deuised

request of the king, receiued of him the order of the Garter, for the which he was euill
thought of afterwards by his freends, namelie the French king and others. Finallie,
after the king had thus feasted the strangers and others at Windsore, each man tooke

their staues being crasht in sunder, flue vp into the aire, and the broken stocke or
stumpe hitting the aduersarie ouerthrew him to the ground: the beholders with ioy of
heart gaue a shout thereat, as greatlie delighted with the sight. Then came the night and
brake off the first daies tornement. On the next daie when they should renew and fall
afresh vnto it againe, they shewed themselues in courage equall to their ancestors, and
handled their matters so well that they got them great renowme. The third daie came,
and the multitude of people still gathered togither woondered at the right valiant deeds
of the valorous horssemen, how they did tosse, hoisse vp, and wind their speares, and
with what force they vsed their armes, what courage appeared in their statelie horsses, and
how the verie heauens rang with the ratling of their armor, and the strokes giuen to and
fro. Euerie daie brought with it his portion of pleasure, both to the contenders, and to
the beholders. When the time was expired of this tried chiualrie, necessarie occasion
mooued the king of England to set his mind on other matters, so that commending the
prowesse of the outlandish lords, he bestowed vpon them massie cheines of gold, &amp; loding
them with other gifts of great valure, dismissed them into their countries. But the English
challengers required nothing but renowme for their reward, being allured onelie with
the loue of praise; and thus when these pastimes of chiualrie were quite ended, euerie
man got him home to his owne house. Thus farre Christopher Okland, touching the

<p>Ambassadors from the French king for a perpetual peace. <i>Froissard</i>.</p>

<p>A proclamatiō that all English beneficed men in Rome should
returne into England.</p></div>

<p>Ambassadors were sent from the French king, vnto the king of England, to make an
ouerture of peace to be had, and to indure for euer betwixt the two realmes of England
and France, sith that by warre it was apparant inough, that neither realme,
could greatlie <span class="xxpn" id="p813">|813|</span>
benefit it selfe,
but rather sore indamage either other, as afore time it had come apparantlie
to passe. Therefore the matter being well considered, both parts séemed well
affected towards some good conclusion by treatie to be had of a full and perfect peace.
About the same time, by the king with the aduise of his councell, proclamation was made
and published at London, that all beneficed men abiding in the court of Rome, being
Englishmen borne, should returne home into England before the feast of S. Nicholas,
vnder paine to forfeit all their benefices; and such as were not beneficed, vnder a paine
likewise limited. The Englishmen hearing such a thunder clap a farre off, fearing the
blow, left the popes court, and returned into their natiue soile.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The pope sendeth his nuncio to king Richard.</p></div>

<p>The pope troubled with such a rumbling noise, sent in all hast an abbat as his nuncio
vnto the king of England, as well to vnderstand the causes of this proclamation, as of
statutes deuised and made latelie in parlement against those that prouided themselues of
benefices in the court of Rome by the popes buls, which séemed not a little preiudiciall
to the church of Rome: in con­si­der­a­tion whereof the said nuncio required that the same
statutes might be repealed and abolished, so farre as they tended to the derogation of the
church liberties: but if the same statutes were not abolished, the pope might not (said
his nuncio) with a safe conscience otherwise doo than procéed against them that made
those statutes, in such order as the canons did appoint. Moreouer the said nuncio declared
to the king certeine dangerous practises betwixt the antipape and the French king;
as to make the duke of Touraine the French kings brother king of Tuscane and Lombardie,
and to establish the duke of Aniou in the kingdome of Sicile.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The popes nuncio openeth to the king the Frēch kings priuie practises.</p>

<p>Moreouer, he gaue the king to vnderstand, that if the French king might compasse by
the antipapes meanes to be chosen emperour, he would seeke to vsurpe vpon ech mans
right, and therefore it stood the king of England chieflie in hand to prouide against such
practises in time. And as for the treatie of peace which the Frenchmen séemed so much
to fauour, it was to none other end, but that vpon agreement once had, they might
more conuenientlie compasse their purpose in the premisses.
Furthermore the nuncio
earnestlie besought the king of aid in the popes behalfe against the French king, if (as he
threatned to doo) he should inuade him in Italie with open force. The king séemed to
giue fauourable eare vnto the nuncio, and after aduise taken, appointed to staie till
after Michaelmasse, at what time a parlement was appointed to be assembled, wherein
such things as he had proponed should be weied and considered, and some conclusion
taken therein.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>A sore bridle for the clergie.</p></div>

<p>About this time or in the yeare 1391, according to Henrie Knightons account, there
was a prophane statute made against the church &amp; churchmen; namelie, that no ecclesiastical
person or persons should possesse manors, glebeland, houses, possessions, lands,
reuenues or rents whatsoeuer, at the hands of the feoffer, without the kings licence &amp; the
chiefe lords. And this statute extended it selfe, as well to parish churches, chappels,
chanteries, as abbeies, priories, &amp; other monasteries whatsoeuer: likewise to citizens of
cities, to farmers, &amp; burgesses, hauing such rents or possessions for the common profit.
For men in those daies, that would bestow land or liuelod vpon church, fraternitie, or
conuent, and were not able for cost and charges to procure a mortmane, vnder the kings
licence and chiefe lords; were wont to feoffe some speciall men, in whom they had confidence
and trust; vnder whose name and title, churchmen, or anie other fraternitie or
conuent might inioy the profit of the gift, and might haue the commoditie thereof in possession.
And it was prouided by that statute, that all and euerie as well persons ec­cles­i­ast­i­call
as parishioners, both citizens, burgesses, and farmers, or anie other whatsoeuer,
hauing such rents, possessions, manors, or anie reuenues whatsoeuer, in the hands of such
feoffers, without the licence of the king and chiefe lords; that either they should obteine
and get a licence of the king and the chiefe lords to make it a mortmaine; or else
set such things to sale, &amp; raise profit of them, on this side or before the feast of Michaelmasse
next insuing: or the said feast being past and expired, that then
the king and the <span class="xxpn" id="p814">|814|</span>

the same, and them haue and hold at his and their pleasure.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>About the same time, the duke of Glocester went into Prutzen land, to the great griefe
of the people, that made account of his departure, as if the sunne had beene taken from
the earth, doubting some mishap to follow to the common wealth by his absence, whose
presence they thought sufficient to stay all detriments that might chance, for in him the
hope of the commons onelie rested. In his returne home, he was sore tormented with
rough weather and tempestuous seas. At length he arriued in North­um­ber­land, and
came to the castell of Tinmouth, as to a sanctuarie knowen to him of old, where after

<p>The price of corne that had continued at an high rate, almost for the space of two
yeares, began to fall immediatlie after haruest was got in, to the great reliefe of the poore,
which before through immoderate eating of nuts and apples, fell into the disease called
the flix, whereof manie died, and suerlie (as was thought) the death and dearth had
beene greater, if the commendable diligence of the lord maior of London had not béene,

H. Knighton <span class="xxpn" id="p816">|816|</span>
referreth this scarsitie to the yeare 1390, and maketh a large discourse both of the miseries
which it brought with it, as also of the cause whereby it was procured, and of the notable
meanes whereby the same in most places was remedied.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Wooll sold dogcheape by the stone.</p>

<p>Prouision against scarsitie to relieue the poore.</p>

<p>O charitie of London!</p></div>

<p>In this yeare (saith he) was a great dearth in all parts of England, and this dearth or
scarsitie of corne began vnder the sickle, and lasted till the feast of saint Peter ad vincula,
to wit, till the time of new corne. This scarsitie did greatlie oppresse the people,
and chieflie the commoners of the poorer sort. For a man might sée infants and children
in stréets and houses, through hunger, howling, crieng, and crauing bread: whose mothers
had it not (God wot) to breake vnto them. But yet there was such plentie and abundance
of manie yeares before, that it was thought and spoken of manie housekéepers and
husbandmen, that if the séed were not sowen in the ground, which was hoorded vp and
stored in barnes, lofts, and garners, there would be inough to find and susteine all the
people by the space of fiue yeares following. But the cause of this penurie, was thought
to be the want of monie in a great manie. For monie in these daies was verie scant,
and
the principall cause hereof was, for that the wooll of the land lay a sléepe and hoong
heauie in some mens hands by the space of two yeares; and in others thrée yeares, without
a chapman. For it was enacted in a certeine parlement, that the merchants of England
should not passe out of the land with wooll and other merchandize, but should bring
the same vnto twelue places within the realme appointed for the same purpose, that the
merchants strangers might haue recourse thither with their commodities and so by exchange
should transport our merchandize for theirs. By meanes whereof the merchants
of England did forbeare to buy wooll and other wares vntil the next parlement insuing,
wherein it was granted them to traffike whither they would with their commodities.
In these daies wooll was dogcheape: for one stone of good wooll of the chosen and piked
sort, was sold for thrée shillings, and in Leicester and Kent at some times for two shillings
or two and twentie pence. This scarsitie of victuals was of greatest force in Leicester
shire, &amp; in the middle parts of the realme. And although it was a great want,
yet was not the price of corne out of reason. For a quarter of wheat, when it was at
the highest, was sold at Leicester for 16 shillings 8 pence at one time, and at other times
for a marke or fourteene shillings: at London and other places of the land a quarter
of wheat was sold for ten shillings, or for litle more or lesse. For there arriued eleuen
ships laden with great plentie of victuals at diuerse places of the land,
for the reliefe of
the people. Besides this, the citizens of London laid out two thousand marks to buy
food out of the common chest of orphans: and the foure and twentie aldermen, euerie
of them put in his twentie pound a péece for necessarie prouision, for feare of famine,
likelie to fall vpon the citie. And they laid vp their store in sundrie of the fittest and
most conuenient places they could choose, that the néedie, and such as were wroong
with want, might come &amp; buy at a certeine price so much as might suffice them and
their familie: and they which had not readie monie to paie downe presentlie in hand,
their word and credit was taken for a yeares space next following, and their turne serued.
Thus was prouision made that people should be relieued, and that none might perish
for hunger.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>On Christmasse day, a dolphin that came foorth of the sea vp the Thames vnto
London-bridge, was espied of the citizens as he plaied in the water, and being followed
&amp; pursued, with much adoo was taken. He was ten foot long, and a monstrous growne
fish, so as the sight of him was strange to manie that beheld him. He was thought by his
comming so farre into the landward, to foreshew such stormes and tempests as within a
wéeke after did raginglie follow.
Ye haue heard how the matter for a treatie of peace
had béene first broched by the French king, by sending ambassadors to the king of England,
to mooue the same.
Which motion being throughlie considered of the estates
assembled in this last parlement, it was decréed, that it should go forward (as before ye
haue heard) and so about Candlemasse, the lord Thomas Persie, sir
Lewes Clifford, and <span class="xxpn" id="p817">|817|</span>
sir Robert Briquet, with diuerse other in their companie, were sent ouer to the French
king, and comming to Paris, found him lodgd in his house of Loure, where they declared
to him the good affection of the king their maister toward peace. And the better to bring
it to passe, they shewed that king Richards desire was to haue some place and time appointed
for com­mis­sion­ers to méet, with authoritie to treat and conclude vpon articles, as
should be thought expedient. The French king greatlie honored these ambassadors, in
feasting and banketting them for the space of six daies togither, and for answer, concluded
with them, that he himselfe, with his vncles and other of his councell, would be at
Amiens by the middest of March next insuing, there to abide the king of Englands comming,
and his vncles, if it should please them thither to come.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The English ambassadors said there was no doubt, but that either the king himselfe, or

that should seeme reasonable, and so those ambassadors returned with great gifts
presented on the kings behalfe to ech of them, sir Robert Briquet excepted, vnto whome
it séemed the French king bare no great good will, for that being a Frenchman borne, he
had euer serued the Nauarrois or Englishmen, and was now one of king Richards priuie
chamber. The king of England (as some write) was once minded to haue passed the
seas himselfe, to haue met the French king at Amiens, at the time appointed, but finallie
the duke of Lancaster, the bishop of Durham, and others, were sent thither with a traine
néere hand of a thousand horsses. At their comming into France, they were roiallie
receiued: for the French king had made no lesse preparation for the duke of Lancasters
comming, than if he had béene emperor. The duke of Lancaster verelie was estéemed
to be a verie mightie prince, and one of the wisest and sagest princes in all christendome,
in those daies; so that it séemed the French king reioised greatlie, that he might come
to haue conference with him. There were with the French king héere at Amiens, his
brother the duke of Thoureigne; his vncles, the dukes of Berrie, Burbon, and Burgognie,
&amp; a great number of earles, lords, and other nobles of the realme of France. Before the
Englishmens comming, for auoiding of strife and debate that might arise betwixt the English
and French, a proclamation was set foorth conteining certeine articles, for the demeanor
which the French men should obserue towards the Englishmen.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

their treatie, manie things were proponed, diuerse demands made, and some offers,
though to small purpose, for they tooke not effect, insomuch as they departed without
concluding anie thing, further than that the truse which was to end at Midsummer next,
was prolonged to continue one yéere more, that in the meane time, the lords and estates
of the realme of England might assemble, and with good aduise deliberate, whether it
were more expedient to agrée vnto a determinate peace, or to pursue the doubtfull
chances of warre. And such was the end of that roiall ambassage, to the furnishing

<p>Anon after the returne of the duke of Lancaster, and other the ambassadors that had

Stamford, the which (as if it had béene vnto a parlement) there came foorth of euerie
good towne certeine persons appointed to deliberate and take aduise in so weightie a
matter, as either to conclude vpon peace, or else vpon warre. But in the end they
brought little or nothing to passe, sauing that they agréed to haue the truce to indure for
twelue moneths longer: both kings sware to obserue the same, afore such as were
appointed to sée their othes receiued.
About the same time came the duke of Gelderland
into this realme, being the kings cousine, a right valiant and hardie gentleman: he
was honorablie receiued and welcomed of the king, and of his vncles, the dukes of Lancaster
and Glocester.
This duke of Gelderland counselled
the king not to conclude <span class="xxpn" id="p818">|818|</span>

knowne to be both profitable and honorable to him and his realme, promising that if he

summe of one thousand pounds, which they vncourteouslie refused to lend: and moreouer
they fell vpon an Italian or Lombard (as they termed him) whom they beat and
néere hand slue: bicause he offered to lend the king that monie. Whereof when the
king was aduertised, he was sore mooued against them, and calling togither the most part
of the péeres and noble men of his realme, declared vnto them the froward dealings of
the Londoners, complaining sore of such their presumption. The lords and great men,
séeming not greatlie to fauour the Londoners, gaue counsell that the insolent pride of
those presumptuous persons might with speed be repressed. The citizens of London in
those daies (as should appeare) vsing their authoritie to the vttermost, had deuised and
set foorth diuerse orders and constitutions to abridge the libertie of forreners that came
to the citie to vtter their commodites. Religious men that wrote the dooings of that age,
seemed also to find fault with them, for that they fauored Wicliffes opinions, &amp; therefore
did charge them with infidelitie, and mainteining (I know not how) of Lollards &amp;
heretikes: but howsoeuer the matter, went they fell at this present into the kings heauie
displeasure.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A great fire kindled about a little sparke.</p>

<p>A riot by the Londoners vpon the bishop of Salisburies men.</p></div>

<p>Some there be that write, how the king piked the first quarell against the maior and
shiriffes, for a riot committed by the vnrulie citizens, against the seruants of the bishop of
Salisburie: for that where one of the same bishops seruants had taken a horsse-lofe frō a
bakers man, as he passed by in Fléetstréet with his basket to serue his masters customers,
and would not deliuer it againe, but brake the bakers mans head, when he was earnest to
haue recouered the lofe, the inhabitants of the stréet rose, and would haue had the
bishops man to prison for breaking the kings peace: but he was rescued by his fellowes,
and escaped into Salisburie house,
that stood there within the allie, and as then belonged
to his master the bishop of Salisburie, being at that time high treasuror of England. The
people being set in a rage for the rescue so made, gathered togither in great multitudes
about the bishops palace gate, and would haue fetched out the offendor by force.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Walter Romane.</p></div>

<p>To conclude, such a hurling was in the stréet, that the maior, with the shiriffes, &amp;
diuers aldermen came thither with all speed, to take order in the matter, and to sée the
peace kept; but after the cōming thither of the maior, the commons of the citie resorted
to the place in far greater numbers than before; and the more they were the worsse they
were to rule, and would not be persuaded to quiet themselues, except the bishops seruant,
whose name was Walter Romane, might be had out of the house, and committed to prison:
but at length, after manie assaults, lifts, &amp; other indeuours made to haue broken vp
the gates of the house, the maior &amp; aldermen, with other discréet commoners appeased
the people so, as they brought them to quiet, and sent euerie man to his house.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The bishop was then at Windesor where the court laie, who being informed of this

indeed, tooke such indignation therewith, that taking with him Thomas Arundell archbishop
of Yorke, then lord chancellor of England, he went to the king and made an
heinous complaint against the citizens for their misdemeanor, so that his displeasure was
the more kindled against the citizens, in so much that, whether in respect of this last remembered
complaint, or rather for their vncourteous deniall to lend him the thousand
pounds, and misusing the Lombard that offered to lend the same, I cannot saie; but
sure it is, that the maior and shiriffe, and a great sort more of the citizens, were sent for
to come to the court, where diuerse misdemeanors were obiected and
laid to their charge: <span class="xxpn" id="p819">|819|</span>
and not­with­stand­ing, what excuse they pretended, the maior and shiriffes with diuerse
other of the most substantiall citizens, were arrested. The maior was committed to the
castell of Windesor, and the other, vnto other castels and holds, to be safelie kept, till
the king, by the aduise of his councell, should determine further what should be doone
with them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The liberties of the citie were seized into the kings hands, and the authoritie of the

Edward Darlingrug knight, that should both rule the citie, and see that euerie man had
iustice ministred, as the case required. This sir Edward Darlingrug began to gouerne
the citie of London by the name of lord warden, the one and twentith of Iune, on which
day the king entered into the 16 yeare of his reigne: by reason it was thought that the
said sir Edward Darlingrug was ouerfauourable to the citizens, he continued in his office
but till the first of Iulie, and being then discharged, one sir Baldwine Radington, a right
circumspect and discréet knight, was put in that roome, who knew how both to content
the kings mind, and to comfort the citizens, and put them in hope of the kings fauour in

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The liberties of London in part confirmed in part condemned.</p></div>

<p>At length, the king, through sute and instant labour made by certeine noble men,
speciallie the duke of Glocester, began somewhat to relent and pacifie himselfe, as touching
his rigorous displeasure against the Londoners, calling to mind the great honour he
had diuerse waies receiued at their hands, with the great gifts which they had likewise
bestowed vpon him, wherevpon he purposed to deale the more mildlie with them, and so
sent for diuerse of the chiefe citizens to come vnto Windesor, where he then kept his court,
there to shew foorth the priuileges, liberties, and lawes of their citie, as well the new as
old, that with the aduise of his councell, he might determine which should remaine in
force, and which should be abolished. Herevpon, when the said priuileges, and liberties
were laid foorth, to the view of such persons as had to consider of them, some
were ratified, some permitted by tolleration, and some vtterlie condemned and abrogated.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Neither might they recouer at that present, either the person or dignitie of their maior,
nor obteine the kings entire fauour, till they had satisfied the king of the damages and
iniuries by them doone, either to him or his people. And where he had beene at great
charges, in preparing forces to chastise them, as he was determined, if they had not
submitted themselues vnto him, they were sure that their pursses must answer all that
he had laid foorth about that matter. They therfore with humble submission, in recompense
&amp; satisfaction of their trespasses, offered to giue him ten thousand pounds, but
they were for this time sent home, and appointed to returne againe at a certeine day, not
vnderstanding what they must pay, till the king with the aduise of his councell had taken
further order for them. At length, through such dailie sute as was made for the quieting
of the kings hot displeasure towards the Londoners, he was contented to pardon all
offenses past. But first, the citizens were told, that the king meant to come from his
manor of Shene, to the citie of London, and then vndoubtedlie, vpon knowledge had of
their good meanings, hereafter to beare themselues like louing subiects, they should

foure hundred of the citizens on horsebacke, clad in one liuerie, presenting themselues in
that order, vpon the heath on this side Shene, and in most humble wise, crauing pardon
for their offenses past, besought him to take his waie to his palace of Westminster,
thorough the citie of London. This sute made by the recorder, in name of all the
citizens, he gratiouslie granted, and so held on his iournie, till he came to London

returned to London. On the morrow, the maior and his brethren went againe to Westminster,
and there presented the king with two basens gilt, &amp; in them two thousand nobles
of gold, beséeching him to be good and gratious lord to the citie; he receiued their present
in courteous manner, and gaue them manie comfortable words. The third daie
after, they receiued a new confirmation of all their old liberties (at the least such as might be
an aid to the citie, and no detriment to forreners) wherefore, by counsell of their freends,
they ordeined a table for an altar of siluer and gilt, ingrauen with imagerie, and inameled
in most curious wise, conteining the storie of saint Edward, it was valued to be worth a
thousand marks. This was presented to the king, the which he shortlie after offered to
the shrine of saint Edward within the abbeie. The Londoners beléeued, that by these
gifts they had beene quite rid of all danger; but yet they were compelled to giue the king
after this, ten thousand pounds, which was collected of the commons in the citie, not without
great offense and grudging in their minds.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p><i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of <i>Henrie Knighton</i> canon of Leceister abbeie.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ You</span>
haue heard hitherto, what means was made by the maior, aldermen, and whole
bodie of the commonaltie of London to procure the kings maiesties (in whose disfauour
they were deeplie drowned) gratious reconciliation. Wherein though there hath beene
large matter deliuered; yet to set foorth the dignitie thereof the fuller, take heere by the
waie the report of Henrie Knighton. In the yeare (saith he) 1392, the king called a
great councell on the morrow after Trinitie sundaie at Stamford, about certeine affaires
concerning the Frenchmen, in which councell he assembled togither all the old soldiers of
his relme, that by the aduise of the elder sort he might sée what were best for him to doo
in the premisses. The king also held a great councell at Notingham, on the feast of S.
Iohn the Baptist, whereat he caused the maior of London with the foure and twentie
aldermen, the two shiriffes, and foure and twentie of the best commoners of the citie in
the second degrée to be conuented before him. Héere he charged them that they had
forfeited a certeine bond of 9000 pounds to the king, besides the losse of their liberties
and priuileges. Which obligation or bond they had made in former time to the king, their
deserts requiring the same. Now the king, after rehearsall made of their new offenses &amp;
faults, discharged the maior, the two shiriffes, and the rest of his officers of their offices,
and sent the maior and the two shiriffes to certeine places of custodie as his prisoners,
defeating the citie of London of the honour of all their priuileges; in so much that a citizen
or fréeman should haue no more prerogatiue than a forrener or stranger. He appointed
also the lord Edward Balerige to be gouernor therof, to kéepe and see kept the kings
lawes and his liege people within London in due order, vntill such time as the king had
otherwise prouided for them. And he set them a day to answer the king and his councell
to certeine interrogatories on the feast of S. Marie Magdalen then next insuing, at Windsore.
In the meane while, at the mediation of certeine freends and welwillers, the kings
indignation was somewhat mitigated and asswaged towards them; in somuch that at length
he released the maior and the shiriffes, and sent them home to their houses; setting ouer
them not­with­stand­ing a new kéeper or gouernour of the citie, and reseruing in his hand all
the priuileges of the citie. In the meane time, on the sundaie next
after the feast of the <span class="xxpn" id="p821">|821|</span>
Assumption of the blessed virgin Marie; all the wealthiest and worthiest commoners of
the citie came to the king, and submitted themselues and all their goods to his grace, and
then did he first receiue and take them into his fauour. On the wednesdaie insuing, the
king was purposed to come into London, and the citizens in multitudes innumerable met
him on horssebacke; &amp; they that had no horsses went out on foot to welcome him thither;
women also and infants shewed themselues vnto him; likewise the bishop of London, with
all the clergie, no order, degree, condition, estate, or sex of ec­cles­i­ast­i­call dignitie being
excused, went out in procession to meet the king and the quéene with great reioising. It
was reported how in that procession there were aboue fiue hundred boies in surplisses.
Moreouer, the citizens of London trimmed the outsides of their houses and chambers in
euerie stréet through which the king and the queene were to passe, from S. Georges to
Westminster. As for the houses of the welthier sort, they were brauelie garnished with
cloth of gold, siluer, tissue, veluet, &amp; other sumptuous stuffe whatsoeuer by any possible
means could be gotten. In Cheapside there was a conduit, out of the which two spouts
ran with read wine &amp; white, and vpon the conduit stood a little boie apparelled in white
like an angell, hauing a golden cup in his hand, who presented wine to the king and queene
to drinke as they passed by. In the meane time they offered to the king a golden crowne
of great value, and another golden crowne to the quéene; and a while after passing forwards,
they presented to the king a golden tablet of the Trinitie, to the value of eight hundred
pounds: and to the queene another golden tablet of S. Anne, whome she had in
speciall deuotion and reuerence, bicause hir owne name was Anne. Such, and so great,
and so wonderfull honors did they to the king, as the like in former times was neuer doone
to anie king of this realme: and so going forward, they brought the king and the quéene
to Westminster hall. The king sitting in his seat roiall, &amp; all the people standing before
him; one in the kings behalfe as his speaker, gaue the people thanks for the great honour
and princelie presents which they had bestowed vpon the king; and being bidden to fall

<p>The dukes of Lancaster and Glocester went ouer vnto Calis, and downe to Bullongne
came the dukes of Berrie and Burgognie. These noblemen were sufficientlie furnished
with authoritie, to conclude a perfect peace, both by sea and land, betweene the two
realmes of France and England, and all their alies. The place appointed for them to
treat in, was at Balingham, where tents and pauilions were pight vp, for the ease of both
parties. They met there twise or thrise a wéeke, in a faire tent prepared for the purpose,
about nine of the clocke in the forenoone. This was about the beginning of Maie. When
they entered first into com­mun­i­ca­tion, and had séene each others authoritie, one of the
first demands that the Frenchmen made, was to haue Calis raced, in such wise, as there
should neuer be anie habitation there after that time. The dukes of Lancaster and Glocester
answered herevnto, how they had no authoritie to conclude so farre, but that England
should hold Calis still, as in demesne, and true inheritance; and therefore, if they
purposed to enter any further in the treatie of peace, they should ceasse from that demand
and speake no more thereof. When the dukes of Berrie and Burgognie heard their two
cousins of England answer so roundlie, they spake no more of that matter.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Then the dukes of Lancaster and Glocester demanded to haue restitution of all such
lands as had béene deliuered, either to king Richard, or to king Edward the third, or to
anie their deputies or com­mis­sion­ers, and also to haue fullie paid the summe of florens
that was left vnpaid, at the time when the warre reuiued betwixt England and France:
and this the English lawiers prooued to stand with equitie and reason. But neuerthelesse,
the lords and chancellor of France argued to the contrarie, and so agrée they could not,
insomuch as the Frenchmen required, that if the Englishmen meant to haue anie conclusion
of peace, they should draw to some neerer points. At length, the foure dukes tooke
order, that all their demands on either side should be set downe in writing, and deliuered
to either partie in­ter­change­ab­lie, that they might be regarded at length, and such as
should be found vnreasonable, to be raced or reformed. After they had communed togither
diuerse times, and remained there fiftéene daies, they appointed to aduertise the two
kings of their whole dooings, and after nine daies space to meet againe. The French
dukes rode to Abbeuile, where the French king then laie: and the English dukes returning
to Calis, wrote to the king of England, of all the whole matter. The duke of Glocester
was harder to deale with in each behalfe, concerning the conclusion of peace, than
was the duke of Lancaster, for he rather desired to haue had warre than any peace, except
such a one as should be greatlie to the aduantage and honour of the realme of England:
and therefore the commons of England vnderstanding his disposition, agreed that he
should be sent, rather than anie other. For where in times past the Englishmen had
greatlie gained by the warres of France, as well the commons, as the knights and esquires,
who had by the same mainteined their estate, they could not giue their willing consents, to
haue anie peace at all with the Frenchmen, in hope by reason of the wars, to profit themselues,
as in times past they had doone. The French king &amp; nobles of France were greatlie
inclined to peace, and so likewise was the king of England, &amp; the duke of Lancaster.
But the Frenchmen were so subtill, and vsed so manie darke and coloured words, that the
Englishmen had much a doo to vnderstand them: which offended much the duke of
Glocester. But neuerthelesse, at the daie prefixed, these foure dukes met againe at
Balingham, and with the French lords came the king of Armenie, newlie returned into
France foorth of Grecia, for into his owne countrie he durst not come, the Turkes hauing
conquered it, the strong towne of Conich, which the Genowaies
held, excepted. <span class="xxpn" id="p823">|823|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

France and England, in hope to procure the sooner some aid of the kings to recouer his
kingdome. But to conclude after that the dukes, and other with them associat as assistants,
had diligentlie perused and examined the articles of their treatie, they would not
passe nor seale to anie, till all darke and obscure words were cléerelie declared, opened,
and made perfect, so that no generall peace might be concluded. Not­with­stand­ing, as
Froissard saith, a truce for foure yeares space, vpon certeine articles was agreed to be
kept as well by sea as by land. It was thought, that when they were at point to haue
growne to agreement concerning manie articles, if the French king had not newlie fallen
into his former disease of frensie, there had better effect followed of this treatie; but by
occasion of his sicknesse, each man departed, before that anie principall articles could be
fullie ordered and make perfect. The same time, sir Thomas Persie the yoonger was

<p>This yeare on Whitsundaie being the seauenth of Iune, quéene Anne departed this
life, to the great greefe of hir husband king Richard, who loued hir intirelie. She
deceassed at Shene, and was buried at Westminster, vpon the south side of saint
Edwards shrine. The king tooke such a conceit with the house of Shene, where she
departed this life, that he caused the buildings to be throwne downe and defaced, whereas
the former kings of this land, being wearie of the citie, vsed customablie thither to resort,
as to a place of pleasure, and seruing highlie to their recreation. Thus the king, the
duke of Lancaster, and his sonne the earle of Derbie, were widowers, all in one season:
for the ladie Constance duchesse of Lancaster daughter to Peter king of Spaine, deceassed
the last yeare, whilest hir husband the duke of Lancaster was at the treatie in France:
at the same time also deceassed the countesse of Derbie, wife to the lord Henrie earle
of Derbie.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ Moreouer,</span> in this yeare 1394, Isabell duchesse of Yorke departed this

<p>The yearelie reuenues of Ireland in K. Edward the third his daies.</p></div>

<p>This yeare in August, was a proclamation set foorth, that all Irishmen should auoid
this land, and returne home into their owne countrie, before the feast of the Natiuitie
of our ladie, on paine of death. The occasion of which proclamation was, for that such
multitudes of Irishmen were come ouer into this region, in hope of gaine, that the
countries in Ireland, subiect to England, were in manner left void
of people, so that the <span class="xxpn" id="p824">|824|</span>
enimies spoiled and wasted those countries at their pleasure, finding few or none to withstand
them. And where king Edward the third had placed in Ireland his bench and
iudges, with his excheker for the good ad­min­is­tra­tion of iustice and politike gouernement
to be vsed there, he receiued from thence yearelie in reuenues and profits, comming to
his owne cofers, the sum of thirtie thousand pounds: the king now laid foorth no lesse a
summe to repell the enimies, which by absence of those that were come ouer hither,
could not otherwise be resisted, sith the power of the rebels was so increased, and the
force of the countries subiect, thorough lacke of the former inhabitants, so diminished.&#160;
<span class="nowrap">¶ About</span> the feast of the Natiuitie of our ladie, the king set forward to passe into
Ireland, hauing made such preparation for that iournie, as the like for Ireland had not
béene heard of at anie time before. There went out with him the duke of Glocester, the
earles of March, Notingham, and Rutland, the lord Thomas Persie lord steward, and
diuerse other of the English nobilitie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The duke of Lancaster, that in the thirteenth yeare of king Richards reigne had beene
created by authoritie of parlement, duke of Aquitaine, was about this present time sent
thither, with fiue hundred men of armes, &amp; a thousand archers, to take possession of that
duchie, according to the kings grant, by his letters patents thereof had, made, and confirmed
with his seale, in presence of the most part of all the nobles and great lords of
England, to hold all that countrie to the said duke and his heires for euer in as large
manner and forme, as his father king Edward the third, or anie other kings of England,
or dukes of Aquitaine before time had holden, and as king Richard at that season had &amp;
held the same, the homage alwaies yet reserued to the kings of England for euer. But
all this not­with­stand­ing, at his comming thither, so farre were the Gascoignes, and other
people of those marches from receiuing him with ioy and triumph, that they plainelie told
him, they would not atturne to him, nor be vnder his iurisdiction at anie hand, although
he had brought ouer with him com­mis­sion­ers sufficientlie authorised, both to discharge
them of their former allegiance to the king, and to inuest him in possession of that duchie,
in maner and forme as before is said.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But now to returne to king Richard, ye shall vnderstand, that when all his prouision
and roiall armie was readie, about Michaelmas, he tooke the sea, and landed at Waterford
the second of October, and so remained in Ireland all that winter: his people were
lodged abroad in the countrie, and lay so warilie as they might. For although the Irishmen
durst not attempt anie exploit openlie against the Englishmen, after the kings
arriuall with so puissant an armie, yet they would steale sometimes vpon them, where
they espied anie aduantage, and disquiet them in their lodgings. But when the English
still preuailed, diuerse of the greatest princes among them came in, and submitted themselues.
Amongst other, foure kings are mentioned, as the great Onell king of Meth,
Brine of Thomond king of Thomond, Arthur Macmur king of Lineister, and Conhur king
of Cheueno and Darpe: these kings were courteouslie interteined and much made of
by king Richard, who kept his Christmas this yeare at Dubline. And after that feast
was ended, he held a parlement there, to the which all his subiects of Ireland, vnto
whom it apperteined, resorted, as well those that had continued vnder the English
gouernement aforetime, as those that were latelie yéelded.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">

<p>Also at the same time, after the octaues of the Epiphanie, the duke of Yorke, lord
warden of England, now in the kings absence, caused a parlement to be called at Westminster,
to the which was sent foorth of Ireland the duke of Glocester, that he might
declare to the commons the kings necessitie, to haue some grant of monie to supplie his
want, hauing spent no small quantitie of treasure in that iournie made into Ireland.
The dukes words were so well heard and beléeued, that a whole tenth was granted by the
clergie, and a fiftéenth by the laitie; but not without protestation, that those paiements
were granted of a meere good will, for the loue they bare to the king, and to haue his
businesse go forwards, which bicause it required great expenses,
both for that his owne <span class="xxpn" id="p825">|825|</span>

retinue and power could not be mainteined without excessiue charges; they seemed to
be no lesse desirous to haue the same ended, than they which were dailie agents in the
same, not without feare of misfortune likelie to befall them, hauing to deale with a people

<p>At the same time, those that followed Wickliffes opinions, set vp publikelie on the
church doore of Paules in London, and the church doores of Westminster, certeine
writings, conteining accusations of the clergie, and conclusions, such as had not commonlie
béene heard, against ec­cles­i­ast­i­call persons, and the vse of the sacraments, as the
church then mainteined. They were incouraged thus to doo, as it was said, by some
noble men, and knights of great worship, as sir Richard Sturrie, sir Lewes Clifford, sir
Thomas Latimer, sir Iohn Montacute, &amp; others, who comforted &amp; pricked forward those
kind of men, then called heretikes &amp; Lollards, to the confounding of monks, friers, and
other religious persons, by all waies they might. Herevpon, the archbishop of Yorke,
the bishop of London, and certeine other as messengers from the whole state of the
clergie, passed ouer into Ireland, where, to the king they made a grieuous complaint, as
well against those that had framed and set foorth such writings, as against them that
mainteined them in their dooings, and therefore besought him with spéed to returne home
into England, there to take such order, for the restreining of those misordered persons,
as vnto the reliefe of the church might be thought expedient, being then in great danger
of susteining irrecouerable losse and damage, if good reformation were not the sooner
had. King Richard hearing these things, vpon good deliberation had in the matter, determined
to returne home, but first on the day of the Annuntiation of our ladie, he made
the foure aboue remembred kings, to wit, Onell, Brine of Thomond, Arthur of Mackmur,
and Conhur, knights, in the cathedrall church of Dublin, and one likewise sir Thomas

king about Easter came backe into England without anie more adoo, so that the
gaine was thought nothing to counteruaile the charges, which were verie great: for the
king had ouer with him in that iournie, foure thousand men of armes, and thirtie thousand
archers, as Froissard saith he was informed by an English esquier that had béene in that
iournie. The king at his comming ouer, did not forget what complaint the archbishop of
Yorke and the bishop of London had exhibited to him, against those that were called Lollards,
and heretiks, wherevpon immediatlie, he called before him certeine of the noble men,
that were thought and knowne to fauour such kind of men, threatning terriblie, if from
thence foorth they should in anie wise comfort and relieue them. He caused sir Richard
Sturrie to receiue an oth, that he should not mainteine from that day forward anie such
erronious opinions, menacing him, and as it were, couenanting with him by an interchangeable

<p><i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of <i>Henrie Knighton</i> canon of Leicester abbeie.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ By</span>
the report of H. Knighton it should séeme, that this sect (as he calleth them)
mightilie increased, to the no small offense of the lords temporall and spirituall, wherevpon
after sundrie complaints, and serious solicitations for the supplanting of them,
commissions were granted, and the tenure of them (as it should séeme) though not
absolutelie, yet in part executed. Now therefore listen what mine author saith, whose
addition, though by his owne supputation of yeares it require to be placed elsewhere;
yet for the consonancie of the matter, and because writers varie greatlie in their accounts
of time, I haue here inserted the same, as in a verie conuenient place of the historie.
The noblemen and the commons (saith Henrie Knighton) séeing the ship of the church,
with these &amp; other innumerable errors, &amp; verie lewd opinions as it were on all sides from
day to day with ceasselesse violence and force to be shaken;
besought the king in the <span class="xxpn" id="p826">|826|</span>
parlement, that redresse might be had herof; lest the arke of the faith of all the church
by such violences and inforcements giuen in those daies, should through want of gouernement
be battered without remedie, and the glorious realme of England by corrupting of
faith should by little and little be drawne into a distresse of grace and losse of honor.
Wherefore the king vsing the sound counsell of the whole parlement, commanded the
archbishop of Canturburie, &amp; the rest of the bishops of the realme, to execute their
charge and office, all and euerie of them in his and their diocesse, according to the
canon lawes, more seuerelie and zealouslie; to correct the offendors, to examine their
English books more fullie and substantiallie, to root out errors with all their indeuors, to
bring the people into an vnitie of the right faith, to wéed vp out of the church all netles,
thistles, and brambles wherewith she is disgraced; and to beautifie hir with lillies and
roses; and should cause an establishment of his roiall power more boldlie and stoutlie.
And the king foorthwith commanded, without delaie, that his letters patents should be
sent abroad into all and euerie shire of his kingdome; and appointed in euerie shire
certeine searchers for such books and their fauourers; charging them to applie a spéedie
remedie vnto these disorders, and to lay vp the rebels in the verie next gaoles, till the
king sent vnto them. But verie slow execution or none at all followed, because the
houre of correction was not yet come. [Howbeit, to prepare and make an entrance
to the purposed reformation and correction of those enormities, he gaue out a commission
against the Wickleuists, a copie whereof followeth both in Latine and English.
Whereby the world may see how the springing church of Christ was hated and abhorred
of the antichristian rout.]<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Archbishop of Canturburies visitatiō.</p>

<p>Wickleuists excommunicated.</p>

<p>A ridiculous penance.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ About</span>
this time, or (as Henrie Knighton saith) in the yeare 1392, maister William
Courtenie archbishop of Canturburie, brother to the earle of Denshire visited the diocesse
of Lincolne, and on the feast of saint Faith the virgine he visited maister Iohn Bokingham
bishop of Lincolne in the cathedrall church of Lincolne, with the chapter, and an hundred
of the canons, and he came to Leicester abbeie in visitation, the sundaie before the feast
of All saints, where he abode all the tuesdaie, and on the eeue also, of All saints being
mondaie, calling togither all the canons of the said monasterie, with the chaplines of his
owne chappell, euerie of them hauing in their hands burning candels. The same archbishop
confirmed sentence of ex­com­mun­i­ca­tion against the Lollards or Wickleuists, with
their fauourers, which either now mainteined or caused to be mainteined, or hereafter did
mainteine or should mainteine the errours and opinions of master Iohn Wickliffe, in the
diocesse of Lincolne. On the morrow next after All saints, the same bishop flashed out
his sentence of ex­com­mun­i­ca­tion like lightning in open sight, with a crosse set vpright,
with candels burning bright, and with bels roong alowd, and namelie against those of
Leicester towne that had too too much defiled and infected the said towne and countrie.
The archbishop departing from thence, went to saint Peters church, to a certeine anchoresse
named Matildis there kept as in a closet, whom he reprouing about the foresaid
errors and opinions of the Lollards, and finding hir answers scarse aduisedlie made, cited
hir that she should appeare before him, on the sundaie next insuing, in saint Iames his
abbeie at Northampton, to answer vnto the foresaid erronious and prophane points.
Now she appeared at the day appointed, and renouncing hir errours, and hauing penance
inioined hir, she went awaie reformed. But till the second day before the feast
of saint Lucie, she kept hir selfe out of hir closet, and then entred into the same againe.
Other Lollards also were cited, and appeared at Oxford, and in other places, as the
archbishop had commanded them: who renouncing their superstitious errours, and forswearing
their prophane opinions, did open penance. Also one William Smith was
made to go about the market place at Leicester, clothed in linnen [or in a white sheet]
holding in his right arme the image of the Crucifix, and in his left the image of saint Katharine,
bicause the said Smith had sometimes cut in peeces and burned an image of saint
Katharine, whereof he made a fire to boile him hearbes
in his hunger.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>In those daies there was a certeine matrone in London, which had
one onelie daughter, whome manie daies she instructed and trained vp
to celebrat the masse, and she set vp an altar in hir priuie or secret
chamber with all the ornaments therevnto belonging, and so she made hir
daughter manie daies to attire hir selfe like a priest, and to come to
the altar, and after hir maner to celebrate the masse. Now when she
came to the words of the sacrament, she cast hir selfe flat on hir
face before the altar, &amp; † made not the sacrament; but rising vp,
dispatched the rest of the masse euen to the verie end, hir mother
helping hir therein, and dooing hir deuotion. This errour a long time
lasted, till at last by a certeine neighbour that was secretlie called
to such a masse, it was told abroad, and came to the bishops eares, who
causing them to appeare before him, talked with them about that <span class="xxpn" id="p829">|829|</span>
errour, and compelled the yoong woman openlie to shew the priestlie
shauing of hir haire, whose head was found to be all bare and bald. The
bishop sighing and sorrieng that such an errour should happen in the
church in his time, made manie lamentations, and hauing inioined them
penance, dispatched and sent them away. Thus far Henrie Knighton. [It
is not to be doubted, but that in these daies manie of the female sex
be medling in matters impertinent to their degrée, and inconuenient for
their knowledge; debating &amp; scanning in their priuat conuenticles
of such things as wherabout if they kept silence, it were for their
greater commendation; presuming, though not to celebrat a masse, or

<p>A coniunctiō of Iupiter &amp; Saturne.</p></div>

<p>A certeine thing appeared in the likenesse of fier in manie parts of the realme of England,
now of one fashion, now of another, as it were euerie night, but yet in diuerse
places all Nouember and December. This fierie apparition, oftentimes when any bodie
went alone, it would go with him, and would stand still when he stood still. To some it
appeared in the likenesse of a turning whéele burning; to othersome round in the likenesse
of a barrell, flashing out flames of fier at the head; to othersome in the likenesse of
a long burning lance; and so to diuerse folks at diuerse times and seasons it shewed it
selfe in diuerse formes and fashions a great part of winter, speciallie in Leicestershire and
North­amp­ton­shire: and when manie went togither, it approched not neere them, but
appeared to them as it were a far off. In a parlement time there was a certeine head of
wax made by the art of necromancie (as it was reported) which head at an houre appointed
to speake, vttered these words following at thrée times, and then ceased to speake
any more. These be the words; first, The head shall be cut off; secondlie, The head
shall be lift vp aloft; thirdlie, The feet shall be lift vp aloft aboue the head. This happened
in the time of that parlement which was called the mercilesse parlement, not long
before the parlement that was named the parlement which wrought wonders. In Aprill
there was séene a fierie dragon in manie places of England; which dreadfull sight as it
made manie a one amazed, so it ministred occasion of mistrust to the minds of the maruellors,
that some great mischéefe was imminent, whereof that burning apparition was a
prog­nos­ti­ca­tion. In this kings daies (as saith Thomas Walsingham) whose report, bicause
I am here dealing with certeine prodigious accidents importing some strange euents,
I am the more bold to interlace about the troublesome time when discord sprang betwéene
the king and his youthlie companions with the duke of Lancaster, in the moneth
of Maie, there happened a coniunction of the two greatest planets, namelie Iupiter and
Saturne, after the which did follow a verie great commotion of kingdoms, as in the processe
of this historie may appeare.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>A schisme betwéene two popes for the dignitie of S. Peters chaire.</p></div>

<p>The French king about this time summoned a conuocation of the French cleargie, to
decide and search out the power of the two popes, which of them had fuller right and
authoritie in S. Peters chaire, for the schisme and diuision betwéene the two popes was
not yet ended. The French clergie wrote in the behalfe of Clement their pope, &amp; cōfirmed
their script or writing with the vniuersitie seale of Paris. Which writing Charles
the French king sent ouer to Richard king of England, that touching these doubts and
difficulties he with the councell of his cleargie might deliberat. Wherefore king Richard
summoned a conuocation at Oxford of the lerneder diuines as well regents as not regents
of the whole realme; who wrote for and in the behalfe of Vrbane their pope of Rome,
and confirmed their writing with the vniuersitie seale of Oxford, &amp; sent it ouer sea to
Paris vnto the French king. But nothing was doone further in the premisses, both
popes, vnder the shrowd or shelter of schisme preuailing betwéene them, iustifieng their
title &amp; interest. [This is the last record found in Henrie Knighton, who for that which

<p>Manie that feared the censures of such high executions, chose rather to paie the monie

Some there were that appealed to the sée of Rome, meaning to defend their cause and to
procure that so vnlawfull an exaction might be reuoked. Speciallie, the prebendaries of
Lincolne stood most stiffelie against those bishops, but the death of the archbishop that

Waltham bishop of Salisburie, and lord treasuror of England departed this life, and by

Yée haue heard, that in the yeare 1392, Robert Véer duke of Ireland departed this life
in Louaine in Brabant. King Richard therefore this yeare in Nouember, caused his

Essex, appointing him to be laid in a coffine of cypresse, and to be adorned with princelie
garments, hauing a chaine of gold about his necke, and rich rings on his fingers. And to
shew what loue and affection he bare vnto him in his life time, the king caused the coffine
to be opened, that he might behold his face bared, and touch him with his hands: he
honored his funerall exequies with his presence, accompanied with the countesse of Oxenford,
mother to the said duke, the archbishop of Canturburie, and manie other bishops,

otherwise than as a lieutenant or substitute to the king of England, and in the end addressed

Lancaster vsed all waies he might deuise, how to win their good wils, and had sent

that finallie <span class="xxpn" id="p831">|831|</span>

England, least that by this transporting thereof, it might fortune in time, that the heritage
thereof should fall into the hands of some stranger, and enimie to the English nation, so
that then the homage and souereigntie might perhaps be lost for euer. Indeed, the duke
of Glocester, being a prince of an high mind, &amp; loth to haue the duke of Lancaster at
home, being so highlie in the kings fauor, could haue béene well pleased, that he should
haue enioied his gift, for that he thought thereby to haue borne all the rule about the

the lord Spenser, the lord Clifford named Lewes, and twentie knights with fortie

yeares of age, which before had beene promised vnto the duke of Britaines sonne: but in
con­si­der­a­tion of the great benefit that was likelie to insue by this com­mun­i­ca­tion and

These English lords, at their comming to Paris, were ioifullie receiued, and so courteouslie
interteined, banketted, feasted, and cherished, and that in most honorable sort, as nothing
could be more: all their charges and expenses were borne by the French king, and when

<p>But now when the duke of Lancaster had, by laieng foorth an inestimable masse of
treasure purchased in a manner the good wils of them of Aquitaine, and compassed his
whole desire, he was suddenlie countermanded home by the king, and so to satisfie the
kings pleasure, he returned into England, and comming to the king at Langleie, where he
held his Christmasse, was receiued with more honor than loue, as was thought; wherevpon
he rode in all hast that might be to Lincolne, where Katharine Swinford as then laie,
whom shortlie after the Epiphanie, he tooke to wife. This woman was borne in Heinault,
daughter to a knight of that countrie, called sir Paou de Ruet: she was brought vp in hir
youth, in the duke of Lancasters house, and attended on his first wife the duchesse
Blanch of Lancaster, and in the daies of his second wife the duchesse Constance, he kept
the foresaid Katharine as his concubine, who afterwards was married to a knight of England,
named Swinford, that was now deceassed. Before she was married, the duke had by
hir three children, two sonnes and a daughter; one of the sons was named Thomas de
Beaufort, &amp; the other Henrie, who was brought vp at Aken in Almaine, prooued a good

<p>For the loue that the duke had to these his children, he married their mother the said
Katharine Swinford, being now a widow, whereof men maruelled much, considering hir
meane estate was farre vnmeet to match with his highnesse, and nothing comparable in
honor to his other two former wiues. And indeed, the great ladies of England, as the
duches of Glocester, the countesses of Derbie, Arundell and others, descended of the
blood roiall, greatlie disdeined, that she should be matched with the duke of Lancaster,
and by that means be accompted second person in the realme, and preferred in roome

should be present, for it should be a shame to them that a woman of so base birth, and
concubine to the duke in his other wiues daies, should go and haue place before them.
The duke of Glocester also, being a man of an high mind and stout stomach, misliked his
brothers matching so meanlie, but the duke of Yorke bare it well inough, and verelie, the
ladie hir selfe was a woman of such bringing vp, and honorable demeanor, that enuie could
not in the end but giue place to well deseruing. About this

thencefoorth she was called quéene of England.
Amongst other couenants and articles
of this marriage, there was a truce accorded, to indure betwixt the two realms of England
and France, for tearme of thirtie yeares. The pope wrote to king Richard, beseeching
him to assist the prelats against the Lollards (as they tearmed them) whom he pronounced
to be traitors, both to the church and kingdome, and therefore he besought
him to take order for the punishment of them, whom the prelats should denounce to be

his vncles the dukes of Yorke and Glocester, and a great manie of other lords and ladies
of honour, and thither came to him the duke of Burgognie, and so they communed of the

<p>The talke betwixt the king and the duke of Glocester.</p>

<p>Out of a French pamphlet.</p></div>

<p>In this twentith yeare of his reigne king Richard receiuing the summes of monie (for
the which the strong towne of Brest was ingaged to him) by euill counsell (as manie
thought) deliuered it vnto the duke of Britaine, by reason whereof no small sparke of
displeasure arose betwixt the king and the duke of Glocester, which kindled vp such a
flame (as it was easie to doo) finding matter inough to féed vpon in both their brests,
that finallie it could no longer be kept downe, nor by any meanes quenched. In the
moneth of Februarie, the king holding a sumptuous feast at Westminster, many of the
soldiors that were newlie come from Brest preased into the hall, and kept a roome togither.
Whom as the duke of Glocester beheld, and vnderstood what they were, to
remember how that towne was giuen vp contrarie to his mind and pleasure, it grieued
him not a little: and therefore as the king was entred into his chamber, and few about
him, he could not forbeare, but brake foorth, and said to the king: “Sir, saw ye not
those felowes that sate in such number this daie in the hall, at such a table?” The king
answered that “he saw them,” and asked the duke what they were? To whom the
duke made this answer: “Sir, these be the soldiors that came from Brest, and haue
nothing now to take to, nor yet know how to shift for their liuings, and the worse, for
that (as I am informed) they haue béene euill paied.” Then said the king; “That is
against my will, for I would that they should haue their due wages; and if anie haue
cause to complaine, let them shew the matter to the treasuror, and they shall be reasonablie
answered:” and herewith he commanded that they should be appointed to foure
certeine villages about London, there to remaine, and to haue meate, drinke, and lodging
vpon his charges till they were paied.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Thus as they fell into reasoning of this matter, the duke said
to the king: “Sir, your <span class="xxpn" id="p835">|835|</span>
grace ought to put your bodie in paine to win a strong hold or towne by feats of war,
yer you take vpon you to sell or deliuer anie towne or strong hold gotten with great
aduenture by the manhood and policie of your noble progenitours.” To this the king
with changed countenance answered and said: “Vncle, how say you that?” And the
duke boldlie without feare recited the same againe, not changing one word in anie better
sort. Wherevpon the king being more chafed, replied; “Sir, thinke you that I am a
merchant, or a verie foole, to sell my land? By saint Iohn Baptist no: but truth it is,
that our coosine the duke of Britaine hath satisfied vs in all such summes of monie as our
progenitors lent vnto him, and to his ancestors, vpon gage of the said towne of Brest, for
the which reason and conscience will no lesse but that the towne should therevpon be to
him restored.” Vpon this multiplieng of woords in such presumptuous maner by the
duke against the king, there kindeled such displeasure betwixt them, that it neuer ceassed
to increase into flames, till the duke was brought to his end.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of saint Paule his counsell to K. Richard.</p>

<p><i>Polydor.</i></p></div>

<p>The earle of saint Paule at his last comming into England to receiue king Richards oth
for obseruing the truce, had conference with the king of diuerse matters. The king by
waie of complaint, shewed vnto him how stiffe the duke of Glocester was in hindering all
such matters as he would haue go forward, not onlie séeking to haue the peace broken
betwixt the realmes of England &amp; France, but also procuring trouble at home, by stirring
the people to rebellion. The earle of saint Paule hearing of this stout demeanor of the
duke, told the king that it should be best to prouide in time against such mischéefs as
might insue thereof, and that it was not to be suffered, that a subiect should behaue himselfe
in such sort toward his prince. The king marking his woords, thought that he gaue
him good and faithfull counsell, and therevpon determined to suppresse both the duke
and other of his complices, and tooke more diligent regard to the saiengs &amp; dooings of
the duke than before he had doone. And as it commeth to passe that those which suspect
anie euill, doo euer déeme the woorst; so he tooke euerie thing in euill part, insomuch
that he complained of the duke vnto his brethren the dukes of Lancaster and Yorke, in
that he should stand against him in all things and seeke his destruction, the death of his
counsellors, and ouerthrow of his realme.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The dukes of Lancaster &amp; Yorke excuse the duke of Glocester to the king.</p></div>

<p>The two dukes of Lancaster and Yorke to deliuer the kings mind of suspicion, made
answer, that they were not ignorant, how their brother of Glocester, as a man sometime
rash in woords, would speake oftentimes more than he could or would bring to effect, and
the same proceeded of a faithfull hart, which he bare towards the king, for that it grieued
him to vnderstand, that the confines of the English dominions should in anie wise be
diminished: therefore his grace ought not to regard his woords, sith he should take no
hurt thereby. These persuasions quieted the king for a time, till he was informed of the
practise which the duke of Glocester had contriued (as the fame went amongst diuerse
persons) to imprison the king. For then the duke of Lancaster and Yorke, first reprouing
the duke of Glocester for his too liberall talking, vttering vnaduisedlie woords that
became not his person, and which to haue concealed had tended more to the opinion of
vertue, than to lash out whatsoeuer his vnstaied mind affoorded, which is a great fault
(as in effect the poet noteth:<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div><div class="pstanza">
<p class="pverse">Eximia est virtus præstare silentia rebus,</p>
<p class="pversea">At contra grauis est culpa tacenda loqui)</p>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">and perceuing that he set nothing by their woords, were in doubt least if they should
remaine in the court still, he would vpon a presumptuous mind, in trust to be borne
out by them, attempt some outragious enterprise. Wherefore they thought best to depart
for a time into their countries, that by their absence he might the sooner learne to staie
himselfe for doubt of further displeasure. But it came to passe, that their departing
from the court was the casting awaie of the duke of Glocester. For after that they were
gone, there ceassed not such as bare him euill will, to procure the K. to dispatch him out
of the way. <span class="xxpn" id="p836">|836|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>A conspiracie betwéene the duke of Glocester, and the
abbat of saint Albons.</p>

<p>Out of an old French
pamphlet belonging to <i>Iohn Stow</i>.</p></div>

<p>The duke in déed sore stomached the matter, that his counsell might not be followed
in all things, and speciallie for that he saw (as he tooke it) that the king was misled by
some persons that were about him, otherwise than stood with his honor: for reformation
whereof, he conferred with the abbat of saint Albons, and the prior of Westminster.
The abbat was both his coosine and godfather: and hauing on a daie both the duke and
the prior at his house in saint Albons, after dinner he fell in talke with the duke and prior,
and amongst other com­mun­i­ca­tion required of the prior to tell truth, whether he had
anie vision the night before or not. The prior séemed loth to make a direct answer;
but at length being earnestlie requested as well by the abbat as the duke, he declared
that he had a vision in déed, which was “that the realme of England should be destroied
through the misgouernement of king Richard.” “By the virgine Marie,” said the abbat,
“I had the verie same vision.” The duke herevpon disclosed vnto them all the secrets
of his mind, and by their deuises presentlie contriued an assemblie of diuerse great lords
of the realme at Arundell castell that daie fortnight, at what time he himselfe appointed
to be there, with the earles of Derbie, Arundell, Marshall, and Warwike: also the archbishop
of Canturburie, the abbat of saint Albons, the prior of Westminster, with diuerse
others.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>These estates being come to Arundell castell at the daie appointed, about the verie
beginning of the one and twentith yeare of king Richards reigne, they sware ech to other
to be assistant in all such matters as they should determine, and therewith receiued the
sacrament at the hands of the archbishop of Canturburie, who celebrated masse before
them the morow after. Which doone, they withdrew into a chamber, and fell in
counsell togither, where in the end they light vpon this point; to take king Richard, the
dukes of Lancaster &amp; Yorke, and commit them to prison, and all the other lords of the
kings counsell they determined shuld be drawne and hanged. Such was their purpose
which they ment to haue accomplished in August following. But the earle marshall that
was lord deputie of Calis, and had married the earle of Arundels daughter, discouered
all their counsell to the king, and the verie daie in which they should begin their enterprise.
The king bad the earle marshall take héed what he had said, for if it prooued not
true, he should repent it: but the earle constantlie herevnto answered, that if the matter
might be prooued otherwise, he was contented to be drawne and quartered.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of Rutland saith <i>R. Grafton.</i></p></div>

<p>The king herevpon went to London, where he dined at the house of his brother the
earle of Huntington in the stréet behind All hallowes church vpon the banke of the riuer
of Thames, which was a right faire and statelie house. After dinner, he gaue his
councell to vnderstand all the matter; by whose aduise it was agreed, that the king
should assemble foorthwith what power he might conuenientlie make of men of armes &amp;
archers, and streightwaies take horsse, accompanied with his brother the earle of Huntington,
&amp; the earle marshall. Herevpon at six of the clocke in the afternoone, the iust
houre when they vsed to go to supper, the king mounted on horssebacke, and rode his
waie; whereof the Londoners had great maruell. After that the king began to approch
the dukes house at Plashie in Essex, where he then laie, he commanded his brother the
earle of Huntington to ride afore, to know if the duke were at home, and if he were, then
to tell him that the king was comming at hand to speake with him.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The duke of Glocester arrested.</p></div>

<p>The earle with ten persons in his companie amending his pase (for the king had made
no great hast all the night before, as should appeare by his iournie) came to the house,
and entering into the court, asked if the duke were at home, and vnderstanding by a gentlewoman
that made him answer, that both the duke and duchesse were yet in bed, he
besought hir to go to the duke, and to shew him that the king was comming at hand to
speake with him, and foorthwith came the king with a competent number of men of
armes, and a great companie of archers, riding into the base court, his trumpets sounding
before him. The duke herewith came downe into the base court, where the king was,
hauing none other apparell vpon him, but his shirt, and a cloke
or a mantell cast about <span class="xxpn" id="p837">|837|</span>
his shoulders, and with humble reuerence said that his grace was welcome, asking of the
lords how it chanced they came so earlie, and sent him no word of their comming? The
king herewith courteouslie requested him to go and make him readie, and appoint his
horsse to be sadled, for that he must needs ride with him a little waie, and conferre with
him of businesse. The duke went vp againe into his chamber to put vpon him his clothes,
and the king alighting from his horsse, fell in talke with the duchesse and hir ladies. The
earle of Huntington and diuerse other followed the duke into the hall, and there staied
for him, till he had put on his raiment. And within a while they came foorth againe all
togither into the base court, where the king was deliting with the duchesse in pleasant talke,
whom he willed now to returne to hir lodging againe, for he might staie no longer, and
so tooke his horsse againe, and the duke likewise. But shortlie after that the king and
all his companie were gone foorth of the gate of the base court, he commanded the earle
marshall to apprehend the duke, which in­con­ti­nent­lie was doone according to the kings
appointment.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Out of an old French pamphlet.</p></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ Here</span>
we find some variance in writers. For as by an old French pamphlet (which
I haue séene) it should appeare, the king commanded first, that this duke should be
conueied vnto the tower, where he ment to commen with him, &amp; not in any other place:
but neuerthelesse, the king shortlie after appointed, that he should be sent to Calis, as
in the same pamphlet is also conteined. Other write, that immediatlie vpon his apprehension,
the earle marshall conueied him vnto the Thames, and there being set aboord
in a ship prepared of purpose, he was brought to Calis, where he was at length dispatched
out of life, either strangled or smoothered with pillowes (as some doo write.) For the
king thinking it not good, that the duke of Glocester should stand to his answer openlie,
because the people bare him so much good will, sent one of his iustices called William
Kikill, an Irishman borne, ouer vnto Calis, there to inquire of the duke of Glocester,
whether he had committed any such treasons as were alledged against him, and the earles
of Arundell and Warwike, as after shall be specified. Iustice Kikill hearing what he
confessed vpon his examination, wrote the same as he was commanded to doo, and
therewith spéedilie returned to the king, and as it hath beene reported, he informed the
king (whether trulie or not, I haue not to say) that the duke franklie confessed euerie
thing, wherewith he was charged. Wherevpon the king sent vnto Thomas Mowbraie
earle marshall and of Notingham, to make the duke secretlie awaie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>† For he was son to a king, and vncle to a king.</p></div>

<p>The earle prolonged time for the executing of the kings commandement, though the
king would haue had it doone with all expedition, wherby the king conceiued no small
displeasure, and sware that it should cost the earle his life if he quickly obeied not his
commandement. The earle thus as it séemed in maner inforced, called out the duke at
midnight, as if he should haue taken ship to passe ouer into England, and there in the
lodging called the princes In, he caused his seruants to cast featherbeds vpon him, and so
smoother him to death, or otherwise to strangle him with towels (as some write.) This
was the end of that † nobleman, fierce of nature, hastie, wilfull, and giuen more to war
than to peace: and in this greatlie to be discommended, that he was euer repining against
the king in all things, whatsoeuer he wished to haue forward. He was thus made awaie
not so soone as the brute ran of his death. But (as it should appeare by some authors)
he remained aliue till the parlement that next insued, and then about the same time that
the earle of Arundell suffered, he was dispatched (as before ye haue heard.) His bodie
was afterwards with all funerall pompe conueied into England, and buried at his owne
manor of Plashie within the church there, in a sepulchre which he in his life time had
caused to be made, and there erected.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of Arundell apprehended.</p></div>

<p>The same euening that the king departed from London towards Plashie, to apprehend
the duke of Glocester, the earle of Rutland and the earle of Kent were sent with a great
number of men of armes and archers to arrest the erle of Arundell; which was doone
easilie inough, by reason that the said earle was trained with faire words at
the kings <span class="xxpn" id="p838">|838|</span>
hands, till he was within his danger: where otherwise he might haue béene able to haue
saued himselfe, and deliuered his fréends. The earle of Warwike was taken, and committed
to the tower the same day that the king had willed him to dinner, and shewed him
verie good countenance. There were also apprehended and committed to the tower the
same time, the lord Iohn Cobham, and sir Iohn Cheinie knights. The earle of Arundell
was sent to the Ile of Wight, there to remaine as prisoner, till the next parlement, in the
which he determined so to prouide, that they should be all condemned, and put to death.
And for doubt of some commotion that might arise amongst the commons, he caused it
by open proclamation to be signified, that these noblemen were not apprehended for any
offense committed long agone, but for new trespasses against the king, as in the next parlement
should be manifestlie declared and prooued.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The names of the appellants.</p>

<p>A gard of Cheshire men about the king.</p></div>

<p>Shortlie after, he procured them to be indicted at Notingham, suborning such as should
appeale them in parlement, to wit, Edward earle of Rutland, Thomas Mowbraie earle
marshall, Thomas Holland earle of Kent, Iohn Holland earle of Huntington, Thomas
Beaufort erle of Summerset, Iohn Montacute earle of Salisburie, Thomas lord Spenser,
and the lord William Scroope lord chamberleine. In the meane time, the king fearing
what might be attempted against him by those that fauoured these noblemen that were in
durance, sent for a power of Cheshire men, that might day and night keepe watch and
ward about his person. They were about two thousand archers, paid wéekelie, as by
the annales of Britaine it appeareth. The king had little trust in any of the nobilitie, except
in his brother the earle of Huntington, and the earle of Rutland sonne to the duke
of Yorke, and in the earle of Salisburie: in these onelie he reposed a confidence, and
not in any other, except in certeine knights and gentlemen of his priuie chamber.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>In the meane time, whiles things were thus in broile, before the beginning of the parlement,
diuers other, beside them of whom we haue spoken, were apprehended and put
in sundrie prisons. The parlement was summoned to begin at Westminster the 17 of September,
and writs therevpon directed to euerie of the lords to appeare, and to bring with
them a sufficient number of armed men and archers in their best arraie: for it was not
knowen how the dukes of Lancaster and Yorke would take the death of their brother,
nor how other péeres of the realme would take the apprehension and imprisonment of
their kinsemen, the earls of Arundell and Warwike, and of the other prisoners. Suerlie
the two dukes when they heard that their brother was so suddenlie made awaie, they wist
not what to saie to the matter, and began both to be sorowfull for his death, and doubtfull
of their owne states: for sith they saw how the king (abused by the counsell of euill
men) abstained not from such an heinous act, they thought he would afterwards attempt
greater misorders from time to time. Therefore they assembled in all hast, great numbers
of their seruants, fréends, and tenants, and comming to London, were receiued into
the citie. For the Londoners were right sorie for the death of the duke of Glocester, who
had euer sought their fauour, in somuch that now they would haue béene contented to
haue ioined with the dukes in seeking reuenge of so noble a mans death, procured and
brought to passe without law or reason, as the common brute then walked; although
peraduenture he was not as yet made awaie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p><i>Caxton.</i> <i>Fabian.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></p></div>

<p>Here the dukes and other fell in counsell, and manie things were proponed. Some
would that they shuld by force reuenge the duke of Glocesters death, other thought it
méet that the earles Marshall and Huntington, and certeine others, as chéefe authours
of all the mischeefe should be pursued and punished for their demerites, hauing trained
vp the king in vice and euill customes, euen from his youth. But the dukes (after their
displeasure was somewhat asswaged) determined to couer the stings of their griefes for
a time, and if the king would amend his maners, to forget also the iniuries past. In the
meane time the king laie at Eltham, and had got about him a great power (namelie of
those archers, which he had sent for out of Cheshire, in whome he put a singular trust
more than in any other.) <span class="xxpn" id="p839">|839|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The king and the dukes reconciled.</p></div>

<p>There went messengers betwixt him and the dukes, which being men of honour did
their indeuour to appease both parties. The king discharged himselfe of blame for the
duke of Glocesters death, considering that he had gone about to breake the truce, which
he had taken with France, and also stirred the people of the realme to rebellion, and
further had sought the destruction and losse of his life, that was his souereigne lord and
lawfull king. Contrarilie, the dukes affirmed, that their brother was wrongfullie put to
death, hauing doone nothing worthie of death. At length, by the intercession and meanes
of those noble men that went to and fro betwixt them, they were accorded, &amp; the king
promised from thencefoorth to doo nothing but by the assent of the dukes: but he kept
small promise in this behalfe, as after well appeared.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>When the time came, that the parlement should be holden at Westminster, according
to the tenour of the summons, the lords repaired thither, furnished with great retinues
both of armed men and archers, as the earle of Derbie, the earle Marshall, the earle of
Rutland, the lord Spenser, the earle of North­um­ber­land, with his sonne the lord Henrie
Persie, and the lord Thomas Persie the said earles brother, also the lord Scroope treasuror
of England, &amp; diuerse other. All the which earles and lords brought with them
a great &amp; strong power, euerie of them in their best araie, as it were to strengthen the
king against his enimies. The dukes of Lancaster and Yorke were likewise there, giuing
their attendance on the king with like furniture of men of armes &amp; archers. There was
not halfe lodging sufficient within the citie &amp; suburbes of London for such cōpanies of men

<p>Sir Iohn Bushie speaker.</p></div>

<p>In the beginning of this parlement, the king greatlie complained of the misdemeanour
of the péeres and lords of his realme, as well for the things doone against his will and
pleasure, whiles he was yoong, as for the streit dealing, which they had shewed towards
the quéene, who was thrée houres at one time on hir knees before the earle of Arundell,
for one of hir esquiers, named Iohn Caluerlie, who neuerthelesse had his head smit frō
his shoulders, &amp; all the answer that she could get, was this: “Madame, praie for yourselfe,
and your husband, for that is best, and let this sute alone.” Those that set foorth
the kings greeuances, as prolocutors in this parlement were these: Iohn Bushie, William
Bagot and Thomas Gréene. The king had caused a large house of timber to be made
within the palace at Westminster, which he was called an hall, couered aboue head with
tiles, and was open at the ends, that all men might see through it. This house was of so
great a compasse, that scarse it might stand within the roome of the palace. In this house
was made an high throne for the king, and a large place for all estates besides to sit in.
There were places also made for the appellants to stand on the one side, and the defendants
on the other, and a like roome was made behind for the knights and burgesses
of the parlement. There was a place deuised for the speaker, named sir Iohn Bushie,
a knight of Lincolnshire, accompted to be an exceeding cruell man, ambitious, and
couetous beyond measure.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The archbishop of Canturburie sitting in parlement is accused
of treason by the speaker.</p></div>

<p>Immediatlie after, ech man being placed in his roome, the cause of assembling that
parlement was shewed, as that the king had called it for reformation of diuerse transgressions
and oppressions committed against the peace of his land by the duke of Glocester,
the earles of Arundell, Warwike, and others. Then sir Iohn Bushie stept foorth,
and made request on the behalfe of the communaltie, that it might please the kings highnesse
for their heinous acts attempted against his lawes and roiall maiestie, to appoint
them punishment according to their deseruings, and speciallie to the archbishop of Canturburie
(who then sat next the king) whome he accused of high treason, for that he had
euill counselled his maiestie, inducing him to grant his letters of pardon to his brother the
earle of Arundell, being a ranke traitor.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>Impudent flatterie.</p></div>

<p>When the archbishop began to answer in his owne defense, the
king willed him to sit <span class="xxpn" id="p840">|840|</span>
downe againe and to hold his peace, for all should be well. Herewith sir Iohn Bushie
besought the king, that the archbishop should not be admitted to make his answer, which
if he did, by reason of his great wit and good vtterance, he feared least he should lead
men awaie to beléeue him: so the archbishop might be heard no further. Sir Iohn
Bushie in all his talke, when he proponed any matter vnto the king, did not attribute to
him titles of honour, due and accustomed, but inuented vnused termes and such strange
names, as were rather agreeable to the diuine maiestie of God, than to any earthlie potentate.
The prince being desirous inough of all honour, and more ambitious than was
requisite, seemed to like well of his speech, and gaue good eare to his talke.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p><i>Tho. Walsi.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus when the archbishop was constreined to keepe silence, sir Iohn Bushie procéeded
in his purpose, requiring on the behalfe of the commons, that the charters of pardons
granted vnto the traitors, to wit, the duke of Glocester, and the earles of Arundell and
Warwike, should be reuoked by consent of all the estates now in parlement assembled.
The king also for his part protested, that those pardons were not voluntarilie granted by
him, but rather extorted by compulsion, and therefore he besought them that euerie
man would shew foorth their opinions what they thought thereof. There were two other
persons of great credit with the king, besides sir Iohn Bushie, that were, as before yee haue
heard, verie earnest to haue those charters of pardon reuoked and made void, to wit, sir
William Bagot, and sir Thomas Gréene.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But bicause this matter séemed to require good deliberation, it was first put to the
bishops, who with small adoo gaue sentence, that the said charters were reuocable, and
might well inough be called in: yet the archbishop of Canturburie in his answer herevnto
said, that the king from whome those pardons came, was so high an estate, that he durst
not saie, that anie such charters by him granted, might be reuoked: not­with­stand­ing,
his brethren the bishops thought otherwise: not considering (saith Thomas Walsingham)
that such reuoking of the kings charters of pardon should sound highlie to the kings dishonor:
forsomuch as mercie and pardoning transgressions is accompted to be the confirmation
and establishing of the kings seat and roiall estate.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The charters of pardō granted to <span class="nowrap">y<sup>e</sup></span> lords made void by parlement.</p></div>

<p>The temporall lords perceiuing what the bishops had doone, did likewise giue their
consents, to reuoke the same pardons: but the iudges with those that were toward the
law, were not of this opinion, but finallie the bishops pretending a scrupulositie, as if
they might not with safe consciences be present where iudgement of bloud should passe,
they appointed a laie man to be their prolocutor to serue that turne. To conclude, at
length all maner of charters of pardon were made void, for that the same séemed to impeach
the suertie of the kings person. When sir Iohn Bushie and his associats had obteined
that reuocation, it was further by them declared, that the earle of Arundell had
yet an other speciall charter of pardon for his owne person, which he had obteined after
the first. And therefore sir Iohn Bushie earnestlie requested in name of the communaltie
that the same might likewise be reuoked.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The question then was asked of the bishops, who declared themselues to be of the like
opinion, touching that charter, as they were of the other. At that selfe time the archbishop
of Canturburie absented himselfe from the parlement, in hope that the king would
be his fréend, and stand his verie good lord, for that he had promised nothing should be
doone against him in the parlement whilest he was absent. But neuerthelesse, at the importunate
sute of the said sir Iohn Bushie and others, the archbishop was condemned vnto
perpetuall exile, and appointed to auoid the realme within six wéekes. And therewith the
king sent secretlie to the pope for order that the archbishop might be remooued from his
sée to some other, which sute was obteined, and Roger Walden lord treasuror was ordeined
archbishop in his place, as after shall appeare.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The earle of Arundell areigned.</p>

<p>The duke of Lācaster high Steward of England at this areignement.</p></div>

<p>On the feast daie of saint Matthew, Richard fitz Aleine, earle of Arundell, was
brought foorth to sweare before the king and whole parlement to such articles as he was
to be charged with. And as he stood at the bar, the lord Neuill
was commanded by the <span class="xxpn" id="p841">|841|</span>
duke of Lancaster, which sat that daie as high steward of England, to take the hood from
his necke, and the girdle from his waste. Then the duke of Lancaster declared vnto him,
that for his manifold rebellions and treasons against the kings maiestie he had béene
arrested, and hitherto kept in ward, and now at the petition of the lords and commons,
he was called to answer such crimes as were there to be obiected against him, and so to
purge himselfe, or else to suffer for his offenses, such punishment as law appointed.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of Arundell his answers to the points of his indictmēt.</p></div>

<p>First, he charged him, for that he had traitorouslie rid in armour against the king in
companie of the duke of Glocester, and of the earle of Warwike, to the breach of peace
and disquieting of the realme. His answer herevnto was, that he did not this vpon anie
euill meaning towards the kings person, but rather for the benefit of the king and relme,
if it were interpreted aright, and taken as it ought to be. It was further demanded of
him, whie he procured letters of pardon from the K. if he knew himselfe giltlesse? He
answered, that he did not purchase them for anie feare he had of faults committed by him,
but to staie the malicious speach of them that neither loued the king nor him. He was
againe asked, whether he would denie that he had made anie such rode with the persons
before named, and that in companie of them he entred not armed vnto the kings presence
against the kings will and pleasure? To this he answered, that he could not denie it,
but that he so did.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of Arundell condemned.</p></div>

<p>Then the speaker sir Iohn Bushie, with open mouth, besought that iudgement might be
had against such a traitour: “and your faithfull commons (said he to the king) aske and
require that so it may be doone.” The earle turning his head aside, quietlie said to him;
“Not the kings faithfull cōmons require this, but thou, and what thou art I know.”
Then the eight appellants standing on the other side, cast their gloues to him, and in
prosecuting their appeale (which alreadie had béene read) offered to fight with him man
to man to iustifie the same. Then said the earle, “If I were at libertie, and that it might
so stand with the pleasure of my souereigne, I would not refuse to prooue you all liers in
this behalfe.” Then spake the duke of Lancaster, saieng to him; “What haue you further
to saie to the points before laid against you?” He answered, “that of the kings
grace he had his letters of generall pardon, which he required to haue allowed.” Then
the duke told him, “that the pardon was reuoked by the prelates and noble men in the
parlement, and therefore willed him to make some other answer.” The earle told him againe
“that he had an other pardon vnder the kings great seale, granted him long after of the
kings owne motion, which also he required to haue allowed.” The duke told him, “that the
same was likewise reuoked.” After this, when the earle had nothing more to saie for
himselfe, the duke pronounced iudgement against him, as in cases of treason is
vsed.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But after he had made an end, and paused a little, he said: “The king our souereigne
lord of his mercie and grace, bicause thou art of his bloud, and one of the peeres of the
realme, hath remitted all the other paines, sauing the last, that is to saie, the beheading,
and so thou shalt onelie lose thy head;” and forthwith he was had awaie, &amp; led through
London vnto the Tower hill. There went with him to sée the execution doone six great
lords, of whome there were thrée earles, Notingham (that had married his daughter)
Kent (that was his daughters son) and Huntington, being mounted on great horsses, with
a great companie of armed men, and the fierce bands of the Cheshire-men, furnished
with axes, swords, bowes and arrowes, marching before and behind him, who onelie in
this parlement had licence to beare weapon, as some haue written. When he should
depart the palace, he desired that his hands might be losed to dispose such monie as he
had in his pursse, betwixt that place and Charingcrosse. This was permitted, and so he
gaue such monie as he had in almes with his owne hands, but his armes were still bound
behind him.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The executiō of the earle of Arundell.</p></div>

<p>When he came to the Tower hill, the noble men that were about him, mooued him
right earnestlie to acknowledge his treason against the king.
But he in no wise would <span class="xxpn" id="p842">|842|</span>
so doo, but mainteined that he was neuer traitour in word or deed: and herewith perceiuing
the earles of Notingham and Kent, that stood by with other noble men busie to
further the execution (being as yée haue heard) of kin and alied to him, he spake to
them, and said: “Trulie it would haue beséemed you rather to haue béene absent than
here at this businesse. But the time will come yer it be long, when as manie shall
meruell at your misfortune as doo now at mine.” After this, forgiuing the executioner, he
besought him not to torment him long, but to strike off his head at one blowe, and féeling
the edge of the sword, whether it was sharpe inough or not, he said; “It is verie well,
doo that thou hast to doo quicklie,” and so knéeling downe, the executioner with one
stroke, strake off his head: his bodie was buried togither with his head in the church of
the Augustine friers in Breadstréet within the citie of London.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p><i>Ouid.</i></p></div>

<p>The death of this earle was much lamented among the people, considering his sudden
fall and miserable end, where as not long before among all the noblemen of this land
(within the which was such a number, as no countrie in the world had greater store at that
present) there was none more esteemed: so noble and valiant he was, that all men spake
honour of him. After his death, as the fame went, the king was sore vexed in his sléepe
with horrible dreames, imagining that he saw this earle appeare vnto him threatning
him, &amp; putting him in horrible feare, as if he had said with the
poet to king Richard;<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>With which visions being sore troubled in sleepe, he curssed the daie that euer he knew
the earle. And he was the more vnquiet, bicause he heard it reported, that the common
people tooke the erle for a martyr, insomuch that some came to visit the place of his
sepulture, for the opinion they had conceiued of his holinesse. And where it was bruted
abroad as for a miracle, that his head should be growne to his bodie againe, the tenth daie
after his buriall, the king sent about ten of the clocke in the night, certeine of the nobilitie
to sée his bodie taken vp, that he might be certified of the truth. Which doone, and perceiuing
it was a fable, he commanded the friers to take downe his armes that were set vp about the
place of his buriall, and to couer the graue, so as it should not be perceiued where he was buried.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The earle of Warwike arreigned of treason.</p></div>

<p>But now to returne to the parlement. After the death of this earle, the lord Thomas
Beauchampe earle of Warwike was brought forth to abide his triall by parlement, and
when his accusers charged him in like points of treason, such as before were imposed to
the earle of Arundell; he answered that he neuer meant euill to the kings person, nor
thought that those rodes and assemblies that were made in companie of the duke of
Glocester, the earle of Arundell, and others, might not be accompted treason. But when
the iudges had shewed him, that they could not be otherwise taken than for treason, he humbly
besought the king of mercy and grace. The king then asked of him whether he had rid with the
duke of Glocester, and the earle of Arundell, as had beene alledged? He answered that he
could not denie it, and wished that he had neuer seene them. Then said the king, Doo yee
not know that you are guiltie of treason? He answered againe, I acknowledge it; and with
sobbing teares besought all them that were present, to make intercession to the kings
maiestie for him.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Then the king and the duke of Lancaster communed, and after the king had a while
with silence considered of the matter, he said to the earle; By saint Iohn Baptist,
Thomas of Warwike, this confession that thou hast made, is vnto me more auailable
than all the duke of Glocesters and the earle of Warwikes lands. Herewith the earle
making still intercession for pardon, the lords humblie besought the king to grant it.
Finallie the king pardoned him of life, but banished him into the Ile of Man, which then
was the lord Scroopes, promising that both he, and his wife, and children, should haue
good enterteinment. Which promise not­with­stand­ing was but slenderlie kept, for both
the earle and the countesse liued in great penurie (as some write) and yet the lord
Scroope, that was lord chamberleine, had allowed for the earles diet foure thousand nobles
yéerelie paid out of the kings coffers. <span class="xxpn" id="p843">|843|</span><br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>On the mondaie next after the arreignement of the earle of Warwike, to wit, the foure
and twentie of September, was the lord Iohn Cobham, and sir Iohn Cheinie arreigned,
and found guiltie of like treasons for which the other had beene condemned before: but
at the earnest instance and sute of the nobles, they were pardoned of life, and banished,
or (as Fabian saith) condemned to perpetuall prison.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ The</span> king desirous to see the
force of the Londoners, caused them (during the time of this parlement) to muster before
him on Blacke heath, where a man might haue seene a great number of able personages.
And now after that the parlement had continued almost till Christmasse, it was adiourned
vntill the quinden of S. Hilarie, then to begin againe at Shrewesburie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The king then came downe to Lichfield, and there held a roiall Christmasse, which
being ended, he tooke his iournie towards Shrewesburie, where the parlement was appointed
to begin in the quinden of saint Hilarie, as before yée haue heard. In which
parlement there holden vpon prorogation, for the loue that the king bare to the gentlemen
commons of the shire of Chester, he caused it to be ordeined that from thencefoorth
it should be called and knowne by the name of the principalitie of Chester: and herewith
he intituled himselfe prince of Chester. He held also a roiall feast, kéeping open houshold
for all honest commers, during the which feast, he created fiue dukes and a duchesse, a
marquesse, and foure earles. The earle of Derbie was created duke of Hereford, the
earle of Notingham that was also earle marshall duke of Norfolke, the earle of Rutland
duke of Aubemarle, the earle of Kent duke of Surrie, and the earle of Huntington duke of
Excester; the ladie Margaret marshall countesse of Norfolke, was created duchesse of
Norfolke; the earle of Summerset marques Dorset, the lord Spenser earle of Glocester,
the lord Neuill surnamed Daurabie earle of Westmerland, the lord William Scroope lord
chamberleine earle of Wiltshire, and the lord Thomas Persie lord steward of the kings

<p>And for the better maintenance of the estate of these noble men, whome he had thus
aduanced to higher degrees of honour, he gaue vnto them a great part of those lands that
belonged to the duke of Glocester, the earles of Warwike, and Arundell. And now he
was in good hope, that he had rooted vp all plants of treason, and therefore cared lesse
who might be his freend or his fo, than before he had doone, estéeming himselfe higher in
degrée than anie prince liuing, and so presumed further than euer his grandfather did,
and tooke vpon him to beare the armes of saint Edward, ioining them vnto his owne armes.
To conclude, whatsoeuer he then did, none durst speake a word contrarie therevnto.
And yet such as were cheefe of his councell, were estéemed of the commons to be the
woorst creatures that might be, as the dukes of Aumarle, Norfolke and Excester, the

<p>But now to proceed. In this parlement holden at Shrewsburie, the lord Reginald Cobham,
being a verie aged man, simple and vpright in all his dealings, was condemned for
none other cause, but for that in the eleuenth yéere of the kings reigne he was appointed
with other to be attendant about the king as one of his gouernours. The acts and ordinances
also deuised and established in the parlement holden in the eleuenth yeare were
likewise repealed. Moreouer, in this parlement at Shrewesburie, it was decréed, that the
lord Iohn Cobham should be sent into the Ile of Gernesie, there to remains in exile, hauing
a small portion assigned him to liue vpon. The king so wrought &amp; brought things
about, that he obteined the whole power of both houses to be granted to certeine persons,
as to Iohn duke of Lancaster, Edmund duke of Yorke, Edmund duke of Aumarle, Thomas
duke of Surrie, Iohn duke of Excester, Iohn marquesse Dorset, Roger earle of
March, Iohn earle of Salisburie, and Henrie earle of North­um­ber­land, Thomas earle of
Glocester, and William earle of Wiltshire, Iohn Hussie, Henrie Cheimeswike, Robert
Teie, and Iohn Goulofer knights, or to seauen or eight of them. These were appointed
to heare and determine certeine petitions and matters yet depending
and not ended: but <span class="xxpn" id="p844">|844|</span>
by vertue of this grant, they procéeded to conclude vpon other things, which generallie
touched the knowledge of the whole parlement, in derogation of the states therof, to the

<div class="sidenotea">

<p>When the king had spent much monie in time of this parlement, he demanded a disme

was granted for all offenses to all the kings subiects (fiftie onelie excepted) whose names
he would not by anie meanes expresse, but reserued them to his owne knowledge, that
when anie of the nobilitie offended him, he might at his plesure name him to be one of the
number excepted, and so kéepe them still within his danger. To the end that the ordinances,
iudgements, and acts made, pronounced and established in this parlement, might
be and abide in perpetuall strength and force, the king purchased the popes buls, in which
were conteined greeuous censures and cursses, pronounced against all such as did by anie
means go about to breake and violate the statutes in the same parlement ordeined. These
buls were openlie published &amp; read at Paules crosse in London, and in other the most

liuings, by authoritie of the same parlement: with which wrongfull dooings the people
were much offended, so that the king and those that were about him, and chéefe in councell,
came into great infamie and slander. In déed the king after he had dispatched the
duke of Glocester, and the other noblemen, was not a little glad, for that he knew them
still readie to disappoint him in all his purposes; and therefore being now as it were carelesse,
did not behaue himselfe (as some haue written) in such discréet order, as manie
wished: but rather (as in time of prosperitie it often happeneth) he forgot himselfe, and
began to rule by will more than by reason, threatning death to each one that obeied not his
inordinate desires. By means whereof, the lords of the realme began to feare their
owne estates, being in danger of his furious outrage, whome they tooke for a man destitute
of sobrietie and wisedome, and therefore could not like of him, that so abused his

<p>Herevpon there were sundrie of the nobles, that lamented these mischéefes, and speciallie
shewed their greefes vnto such, by whose naughtie counsell they vnderstood the king
to be misled; and this they did, to the end that they being about him, might either turne
their copies, and giue him better counsell; or else he hauing knowledge what euill report
went of him, might mend his maners misliked of his nobles. But all was in vaine, for
so it fell out, that in this parlement holden at Shrewsburie, Henrie duke of Hereford
accused Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke, of certeine words which he should vtter in
talke had betwixt them, as they rode togither latelie before betwixt London and Brainford,
sounding highlie to the kings dishonor. And for further proofe thereof, he presented a
supplication to the king, wherein he appealed the duke of Norfolke in field of battell, for
a traitor, false and disloiall to the king, and enimie vnto the realme. This supplication
was red before both the dukes, in presence of the king: which doone, the duke of Norfolke
tooke vpon him to answer it, declaring that whatsoeuer the duke of Hereford had
said against him other than well, he lied falselie like an vntrue knight as he was. And
when the king asked of the duke of Hereford what he said to it: he taking his hood off
his head, said; “My souereigne lord, euen as the supplication which I tooke you
importeth, right so I saie for truth, that Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke is a traitour,

of England: and the duke of Surrie marshall of the realme vndertooke as pledges

<p>The order of the procéeding in this appeale.</p></div>

<p>Now after the dissoluing of the parlement at Shrewsburie, there was a daie appointed
about six wéeks after, for the king to come vnto Windsor, to heare and to take some order
betwixt the two dukes, which had thus appealed ech other. There was a great scaffold
erected within the castell of Windsor for the king to sit with the lords and prelats of his
realme: and so at the daie appointed, he with the said lords &amp; prelats being come thither
and set in their places, the duke of Hereford appellant, and the duke of Norfolke defendant,
were sent for to come &amp; appeare before the king, sitting there in his seat of iustice.
And then began sir Iohn Bushie to speake for the king, declaring to the lords how they
should vnderstand, that where the duke of Hereford had presented a supplication to the
king, who was there set to minister iustice to all men that would demand the same, as
apperteined to his roiall maiestie, he therefore would now heare what the parties could say
one against an other, and withall the king commanded the dukes of Aumarle and Surrie,
the one being constable, and the other marshall, to go vnto the two dukes, appellant and
defendant, requiring them on his behalfe, to grow to some agréement: and for his part, he
would be readie to pardon all that had beene said or doone amisse betwixt them, touching
anie harme or dishonor to him or his realme: but they answered both assuredlie, that it
was not possible to haue anie peace or agréement made betwixt them.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>When he heard what they had answered, he commanded that they should be brought
foorthwith before his presence, to heare what they would say. Herewith an herald in the
kings name with lowd voice commanded the dukes to come before the king, either of them
to shew his reason, or else to make peace togither without more delaie. When they were
come before the king and lords, the king spake himselfe to them, willing them to agree,
and make peace togither: “for it is (said he) the best waie ye can take.” The duke of
Norfolke with due reuerence herevnto answered it could not be so brought to passe, his
honor saued. Then the king asked of the duke of Hereford, “what it was that he demanded
of the duke of Norfolke, and what is the matter that ye can not make peace togither
and become friends?”</p>

<div class="sidenotea">

<p>Then stood foorth a knight; who asking and obteining licence to speake for the duke of
Hereford, said; “Right deare and souereigne lord, here is Henrie of Lancaster duke of
Hereford and earle of Derbie, who saith, and I for him likewise say, that Thomas Mowbraie
duke of Norfolke is a false and disloiall traitor to you and your roiall maiestie, and
to your whole realme: and likewise the duke of Hereford saith and I for him, that
Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke hath receiued eight thousand nobles to pay the souldiers
that keepe your towne of Calis, which he hath not doone as he ought: and furthermore
the said duke of Norfolke hath béene the occasion of all the treason that hath beene
contriued in your realme for the space of these eighteene yeares, &amp; by his false suggestions
and malicious counsell, he hath caused to die and to be murthered your right déere vncle,
the duke of Glocester, sonne to king Edward. Moreouer, the duke of Hereford saith, and
I for him, that he will proue this with his bodie against the bodie of the said duke of Norfolke

these were his words, who answered: “Right déere lord, they are my woords; and hereof
I require right, and the battell against him.”<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>There was a knight also that asked licence to speake for the duke of Norfolke, and

is a lie; and the said Henrie of Lancaster hath falselie and wickedlie lied as a false

<p>The duke of Norfolke his answer for himselfe.</p></div>

<p>The king then demanded of the duke of Norfolke, if these were his woords, and whether
he had anie more to saie. The duke of Norfolke then answered for himselfe: “Right
déere sir, true it is, that I haue receiued so much gold to paie your people of the towne of
Calis; which I haue doone, and I doo auouch that your towne of Calis is as well kept at
your commandement as euer it was at anie time before, and that there neuer hath béene by
anie of Calis anie complaint made vnto you of me. Right deere and my souereigne lord,
for the voiage that I made into France, about your marriage, I neuer receiued either gold
or siluer of you, nor yet for the voiage that the duke of Aumarle &amp; I made into Almane,
where we spent great treasure: Marie true it is, that once I laid an ambush to haue slaine
the duke of Lancaster, that there sitteth: but neuerthelesse he hath pardoned me thereof,
and there was good peace made betwixt vs, for the which I yéeld him hartie thankes.
This is that which I haue to answer, and I am readie to defend my selfe against mine

<p>After this, when the king had communed with his councell a little, he commanded the
two dukes to stand foorth, that their answers might be heard. The K. then caused them
once againe to be asked, if they would agrée and make peace togither, but they both flatlie
answered that they would not: and withall the duke of Hereford cast downe his gage,
and the duke of Norfolke tooke it vp. The king perceiuing this demeanor betwixt them,
sware by saint Iohn Baptist, that he would neuer séeke to make peace betwixt them againe.
And therfore sir Iohn Bushie in name of the king &amp; his councell declared, that the king
and his councell had commanded and ordeined, that they should haue a daie of battell
appointed them at Couentrie.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ Here</span> writers disagrée about the daie that was appointed:
for some saie, it was vpon a mondaie in August; other vpon saint Lamberts
daie, being the seuenteenth of September, other on the eleuenth of September; but true
it is, that the king assigned them not onlie the daie, but also appointed them listes and
place for the combat, and therevpon great preparation was made, as to such a matter
apperteined.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">

<p>At the time appointed the king came to Couentrie, where the two dukes were readie,
according to the order prescribed therein, comming thither in great arraie, accompanied
with the lords and gentlemen of their linages. The king caused a sumptuous scaffold or
theater, and roiall listes there to be erected and prepared. The sundaie before they
should fight, after dinner the duke of Hereford came to the king (being lodged about a
quarter of a mile without the towne in a tower that belonged to sir William Bagot) to
take his leaue of him. The morow after, being the daie appointed for the combat, about
the spring of the daie, came the duke of Norfolke to the court to take leaue likewise of the
king. The duke of Hereford armed him in his tent, that was set vp néere to the lists, and
the duke of Norfolke put on his armor, betwixt the gate &amp; the barrier of the towne, in a
beautifull house, hauing a faire perclois of wood towards the gate, that none might sée what
was doone within the house.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The order of the combat.</p></div>

<p>The duke of Aumarle that daie, being high constable of England, and the duke of
Surrie marshall, placed themselues betwixt them, well armed and appointed; and when
they saw their time, they first entered into the listes with a great companie of men apparelled
in silke sendall, imbrodered with siluer, both richlie and curiouslie, euerie man
hauing a tipped staffe to keepe the field in order. About the
houre of prime came to <span class="xxpn" id="p847">|847|</span>
the barriers of the listes, the duke of Hereford, mounted on a white courser, barded with
gréene &amp; blew veluet imbrodered sumptuouslie with swans and antelops of goldsmiths
woorke, armed at all points. The constable and marshall came to the barriers, demanding
of him what he was, he answered; “I am Henrie of Lancaster duke of Hereford, which
am come hither to doo mine indeuor against Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke, as a
traitor vntrue to God, the king, his realme, and me.” Then in­con­ti­nent­lie he sware vpon
the holie euangelists, that his quarrell was true and iust, and vpon that point he required
to enter the lists. Then he put vp his sword, which before he held naked in his hand,
and putting downe his visor, made a crosse on his horsse, and with speare in hand, entered
into the lists, and descended from his horsse, and set him downe in a chaire of
gréene veluet, at the one end of the lists, and there reposed himselfe, abiding the comming
of his aduersarie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>Soone after him, entred into the field with great triumph, king Richard accompanied
with all the péeres of the realme, and in his companie was the earle of saint Paule, which
was come out of France in post to see this challenge performed. The king had there
aboue ten thousand men in armour, least some fraie or tumult might arise amongst his
nobles, by quarelling or partaking. When the king was set in his seat, which was richlie
hanged and adorned; a king at armes made open proclamation, prohibiting all men in
the name of the king, and of the high constable and marshall, to enterprise or attempt to
approch or touch any part of the lists vpon paine of death, except such as were appointed
to order or marshall the field. The proclamation ended, an other herald cried; “Behold
here Henrie of Lancaster duke of Hereford appellant, which is entred into the lists roiall
to doo his deuoir against Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke defendant, vpon paine to
be found false and recreant.”</p>

<p>The duke of Norfolke houered on horssebacke at the entrie of the lists, his horse being
barded with crimosen veluet, imbrodered richlie with lions of siluer and mulberie trées;
and when he had made his oth before the constable and marshall that his quarrell was
iust and true, he entred the field manfullie, saieng alowd: “God aid him that hath the
right,” and then he departed from his horsse, &amp; sate him downe in his chaire which was
of crimosen veluet, courtined about with white and red damaske. The lord marshall
viewed their speares, to see that they were of equall length, and deliuered the one speare
himselfe to the duke of Hereford, and sent the other vnto the duke of Norfolke by a
knight. Then the herald proclamed that the trauerses &amp; chaires of the champions should
be remooued, commanding them on the kings behalfe to mount on horssebacke, &amp; addresse
themselues to the battell and combat.</p>

<p>The duke of Hereford was quicklie horssed, and closed his bauier, and cast his speare
into the rest, and when the trumpet sounded set forward couragiouslie towards his enimie
six or seuen pases. The duke of Norfolke was not fullie set forward, when the king cast
down his warder, and the heralds cried, Ho, ho. Then the king caused their speares
to be taken from them, and commanded them to repaire againe to their chaires, where
they remained two long houres, while the king and his councell deliberatlie consulted
what order was best to be had in so weightie a cause. Finallie, after they had deuised
and fullie determined what should be doone therein, the heralds cried silence and sir
Iohn Bushie the kings secretarie read the sentence and determination of the king and his
councell, in a long roll, the effect wherof was, that Henrie duke of Hereford should
within fifteene daies depart out of the realme, and not to returne before the terme of ten
yeares were expired, except by the king he should be repealed againe, and this vpon
paine of death; and that Thomas Mowbraie duke of Norfolke, bicause he had sowen
sedition in the relme by his words, should likewise auoid the realme, and neuer to returne
againe into England, nor approch the borders or confines thereof vpon paine of
death; and that the king would staie the profits of his lands, till
he had leuied thereof <span class="xxpn" id="p848">|848|</span>

<p>When these iudgements were once read, the king called before him both the parties, and
made them to sweare that the one should neuer come in place where the other was,
willinglie; nor kéepe any companie to gither in any forren region; which oth they both
receiued humblie, and so went their waies. The duke of Norfolke departed sorowfullie
out of the realme into Almanie, and at the last came to Venice, where he for thought and
melancholie deceassed: for he was in hope (as writers record) that he should haue béene
borne out in the matter by the king, which when it fell out otherwise, it greeued him not
a little. The duke of Hereford tooke his leaue of the king at Eltham, who there released
foure yeares of his banishment: so he tooke his iornie ouer into Calis, and from thence
went into France, where he remained.&#160; <span class="nowrap">¶ A</span> woonder it was to sée what number of

<p>In this meane time, the duke of Lancaster departed out of this life at the bishop of
Elies place in Holborne, and lieth buried in the cathedrall church of saint Paule in London,
on the northside of the high altar, by the ladie Blanch his first wife. The death of
this duke gaue occasion of increasing more hatred in the people of this realme toward the
king, for he seized into his hands all the goods that belonged to him, and also receiued
all the rents and reuenues of his lands which ought to haue descended vnto the duke of
Hereford by lawfull inheritance, in reuoking his letters patents, which he had granted to
him before, by vertue wherof he might make his attorneis generall to sue liuerie for him,
of any maner of inheritances or possessions that might from thencefoorth fall vnto him,
and that his homage might be respited, with making reasonable fine: whereby it was euident,
that the king meant his vtter vndooing.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>This hard dealing was much misliked of all the nobilitie, and cried out against of the

verie néere, as the death of his brother the duke of Glocester, the banishment of his
nephew the said duke of Hereford, and other mo iniuries in great number, which for the
slipperie youth of the king, he passed ouer for the time, and did forget aswell as he might.
But now perceiuing that neither law, iustice nor equitie could take place, where the kings
wilfull will was bent vpon any wrongfull purpose, he considered that the glorie of the
publike wealth of his countrie must néeds decaie, by reason of the king his lacke of wit,
and want of such as would (without flatterie) admonish him of his dutie; and therefore
he thought it the part of a wise man to get him in time to a resting place and to leaue
the following of such an vnaduised capteine, as with a leden sword would cut his owne

<p>He came to Dublin the 28 of Iune as <i>Henrie Marl.</i> saith.</p></div>

<p>The king was sore offended with the obstinatnes of the rebell, that would not agree
otherwise: but so as he might remaine still at libertie, without danger to suffer anie
maner of punishment for his passed offenses. Wherevpon the king after his comming to
Dublin, and that the armie had rested there, and in the countrie neere to the citie, for the
space of fiftéene daies, he diuided his people into three parts, and sent them abroad into
the countrie to pursue the enimies and withall made proclamation, that who so euer could
bring Macmur vnto his presence, should haue for his recompense a great reward: for
he determined not to depart the countrie, till he had him either dead or aliue. But he
knew full little then what incidents to hinder his purposed intention would after follow.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The same daie that he sent abroad his armie thus into three seuerall parts, the duke
of Aumarle with an hundred saile arriued, of whose coming the king was right ioifull;
and although he had vsed no small negligence in that he came no sooner according to
order before appointed, yet the king (as he was of a gentle nature) courteouslie accepted
his excuse: whether he was in fault or not, I haue not to saie; but verelie he was greatlie
suspected, that he dealt not well in tarieng so long after his time assigned. But now
whilest the king rested at Dublin, his people so demeaned themselues, that the most part
of the rebels, what by manhood and policie were subdued, and brought vnder subiection,
and (as is to be thought) if no trouble had risen in England to haue called him backe, he
meant to haue rid vp the woods, and made some notable conquest at that time vpon the
rebels that yet held out. Neuerthelesse, during the time of his abode there, such was
the prowesse of him and his, that the Irish were well tamed, and
forced to submit <span class="xxpn" id="p852">|852|</span>
themselues: and yet the kings power made no great slaughter of them, if it be true that

Stafford bishop of Excester, and for the lord treasuror William Scroope earle of
Wiltshire, and other of the kings priuie councell, as Iohn Bushie, William Bagot, Henrie
Greene, and Iohn Russell knights: of these he required to knew what they thought good
to be doone in this matter, concerning the duke of Lancaster, being on the seas. Their
aduise was, to depart from London, vnto S. Albons, and there to gather an armie to
resist the duke in his landing, but to how small purpose their counsell serued, the conclusion

the lord gouernour of <span class="xxpn" id="p853">|853|</span>
the realme, and the lord chancellor to make what shift they could for themselues: Bagot
got him to Chester, and so escaped into Ireland; the other fled to the castell of Bristow,
in hope there to be in safetie. The duke of Lancaster, after that he had coasted alongst
the shore a certeine time, &amp; had got some intelligence how the peoples minds were affected
towards him, landed about the beginning of Iulie in Yorkshire, at a place sometime called
Rauenspur, betwixt Hull and Bridlington, and with him not past thréescore persons, as
some write: but he was so ioifullie receiued of the lords, knights, and gentlemen of those
parts, that he found means (by their helpe) foorthwith to assemble a great number of
people, that were willing to take his part. The first that came to him, were the lords of
Lincolneshire, and other countries adioining, as the lords Willoughbie, Ros, Darcie, and

vnto him, where he sware vnto those lords, that he would demand no more, but the lands
that were to him descended by inheritance from his father, and in right of his wife. Moreouer,
he vndertooke to cause the paiment of taxes and tallages to be laid downe, &amp; to
bring the king to good gouernment, &amp; to remooue from him the Cheshire men, which
were enuied of manie; for that the king estéemed of them more than of anie other;
happilie, bicause they were more faithfull to him than other, readie in all respects to obeie
his commandements and pleasure. From Doncaster hauing now got a mightie armie
about him, he marched foorth with all spéed through the countries, coming by Euesham

<p>The duke of Yorke, whome king Richard had left as gouernour of the realme in his
absence, hearing that his nephue the duke of Lancaster was thus arriued, and had gathered
an armie, he also assembled a puissant power of men of armes and archers (as
before yée haue heard) but all was in vaine, for there was not a man that willinglie would
thrust out one arrow against the duke of Lancaster, or his partakers, or in anie wise offend
him or his fréends. The duke of Yorke therefore passing foorth towards Wales to méet
the king, at his comming foorth of Ireland, was receiued into the castell of Berkelie, and
there remained, till the comming thither of the duke of Lancaster (whom when he perceiued
that he was not able to resist) on the sundaie, after the feast of saint Iames, which
as that yeare came about, fell vpon the fridaie, he came foorth into the church that stood
without the castell, and there communed with the duke of Lancaster. With the duke of
Yorke were the bishops of Norwich, the lord Berkelie, the lord Seimour, and other:
with the duke of Lancaster were these, Thomas Arundell archbishop of Canturburie that
had béene banished, the abbat of Leicester, the earles of North­um­ber­land and Westmerland,
Thomas Arundell sonne to Richard late earle of Arundell, the baron of Greistoke,
the lords Willoughbie and Ros, with diuerse other lords, knights, and other
people, which dailie came to him from euerie part of the realme: those that came not,
were spoiled of all they had, so as they were neuer able to recouer themselues againe,
for their goods being then taken awaie, were neuer restored. And thus what for loue,
and what for feare of losse, they came flocking vnto him from euerie part.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>At the same present there was arrested, and
committed to safe custodie, the bishop of

Iohn Golofer esquiers. On the morow after, the forsaid dukes with their power, went
towards Bristow, where (at their comming) they shewed themselues before the towne &amp;
castell, being an huge multitude of people. There were inclosed within the castell, the
lord William Scroope earle of Wiltshire and treasuror of England, sir Henrie Greene,
and sir Iohn Bushie knights, who prepared to make resistance: but when it would not
preuaile, they were taken and brought foorth bound as prisoners into the campe, before
the duke of Lancaster. On the morow next insuing, they were arraigned
before the <span class="xxpn" id="p854">|854|</span>
constable and marshall, and found giltie of treason, for misgouerning the king and realme,
and foorthwith had their heads smit off. Sir Iohn Russell was also taken there, who
feining himselfe to be out of his wits, escaped their hands for a
time.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A politike madnesse.</p>

<p>In this meane time, king Richard aduertised, how the duke of Lancaster was landed in
England, and that the lords, gentlemen, and commons assembled themselues to take his
part, he forthwith caused the lord Henrie, sonne to the said duke of Lancaster, and the
lord Humfrie, sonne to the duke of Glocester, to be shut vp fast in the castell of Trimme,
and with all spéed made hast to returne into England, in hope with an armie to incounter
the duke, before he should haue time to assemble his fréends togither. But here you shall
note, that it fortuned at the same time, in which the duke of Hereford or Lancaster, whether
ye list to call him, arriued thus in England, the seas were so troubled by tempests, and
the winds blew so contrarie for anie passage, to come ouer foorth of England to the king,
remaining still in Ireland, that for the space of six wéeks, he receiued no
ad­uer­tise­ments
from thence: yet at length, when the seas became calme, and the wind once turned anie
thing fauourable, there came ouer a ship, whereby the king vnderstood the manner of the
dukes arriuall, and all his procéedings till that daie, in which the ship departed from the
coast of England, wherevpon he meant foorthwith to haue returned ouer into England, to
make resistance against the duke: but through persuasion of the duke of Aumarle (as was
thought) he staied, till he might haue all his ships, and other prouision, fullie readie for
his passage.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>In the meane time, he sent the earle of Salisburie ouer into England, to gather a power
togither, by helpe of the kings freends in Wales, and Cheshire, with all spéed possible,
that they might be readie to assist him against the duke, vpon his arriuall, for he meant
himselfe to follow the earle, within six daies after. The earle passing ouer into Wales,
landed at Conwaie, and sent foorth letters to the kings freends, both in Wales and Cheshire,
to leauie their people, &amp; to come with all spéed to assist the K. whose request,
with great desire, &amp; very willing minds they fulfilled, hoping to haue found the king himselfe
at Conwaie, insomuch that within foure daies space, there were to the number of fortie
thousand men assembled, readie to march with the king against his enimies, if he had béene
there himselfe in person.</p>

<p>But when they missed the king, there was a brute spred amongst them, that the king
was suerlie dead, which wrought such an impression, and euill disposition in the minds of
the Welshmen and others, that for anie persuasion which the earle of Salisburie might vse,
they would not go foorth with him, till they saw the king: onelie they were contented to
staie fouretéene daies to sée if he should come or not; but when he came not within that
tearme, they would no longer abide, but scaled &amp; departed awaie; wheras if the king had
come before their breaking vp, no doubt, but they would haue put the duke of Hereford in
aduenture of a field: so that the kings lingering of time before his comming ouer, gaue
opportunitie to the duke to bring things to passe as he could haue wished, and tooke
from the king all occasion to recouer afterwards anie forces sufficient to resist him.</p>

he tooke the sea, togither with the dukes of Aumarle, Excester, Surrie, and diuerse
others of the nobilitie, with the bishops of London, Lincolne, and Carleill. They landed
néere the castell of Barclowlie in Wales, about the feast of saint Iames the apostle, and
staied a while in the same castell, being aduertised of the great forces which the duke of
Lancaster had got togither against him, wherewith he was maruellouslie amazed, knowing
certeinelie that those which were thus in armes with the duke of Lancaster against him,
would rather die than giue place, as well for the hatred as feare which they had conceiued
at him. Neuerthelesse he departing from Barclowlie, hasted with all speed towards Conwaie,
where he vnderstood the earle of Salisburie to be still remaining.</p>

of his aduersaries, &amp; <span class="xxpn" id="p855">|855|</span>
so at the first he passed with a good courage: but when he vnderstood as he went thus
forward, that all the castels, euen from the borders of Scotland vnto Bristow were deliuered
vnto the duke of Lancaster, and that likewise the nobles and commons, as well of
the south parts, as the north, were fullie bent to take part with the same duke against him;
and further, hearing how his trustie councellors had lost their heads at Bristow, he became
so greatlie discomforted, that sorowfullie lamenting his miserable state, he vtterlie despaired
of his owne safetie, and calling his armie togither, which was not small, licenced
euerie man to depart to his home.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

from his armie, and with the dukes of Excester and Surrie, the bishop of Carleill, and sir
Stephan Scroope, and about halfe a score others, he got him to the castell of Conwaie,
where he found the earle of Salisburie, determining there to hold himselfe, till he might sée
the world at some better staie; for what counsell to take to remedie the mischéefe thus
pressing vpon him he wist not. On the one part he knew his title iust, true, and infallible;
and his conscience cleane, pure and without spot of enuie or malice: he had also no
small affiance in the Welshmen, and Cheshire men. On the other side, he saw the puissance
of his aduersaries, the sudden departing of them whom he most trusted, and all things
turned vpside downe: he euidentlie saw, and manifestlie perceiued, that he was forsaken
of them, by whom in time he might haue béene aided and relieued, where now it was too

proclaimed his brother the earle of North­um­ber­land traitor, brake his white staffe, which

When the kings seruants of houshold saw this (for it was doone before them all) they dispersed

Lancaster vnderstood that king Richard was returned foorth of Ireland, he left the duke
of Yorke still at Bristow, and came backe with his power vnto Berkleie; the second daie
he came to Glocester, and so to Roos, after to Hereford, where came to him the bishop of
Hereford, and sir Edmund Mortimer knight. On the sundaie following, he went to Limster,
and there the lord Charleton came to him. From thence he went to Ludlow, and the

From Shrewsburie, he kept on his iournie towards Chester, and lodging one night

and staied there certeine daies togither, making a iollie muster of his armie there in

for his sonne &amp; heire, &amp; likewise for the duke of Glocesters sonne &amp; heire, that were as

<p>The king kéeping on his waie, had not ridden past foure miles, when he came to the
place where the ambushes were lodged, and being entred within danger of them, before
he was aware, shewed himselfe to be sore abashed. But now there was no remedie: for
the earle being there with his men, would not suffer him to returne, as he gladlie would
haue doone if he might; but being inclosed with the sea on the one side, and the rocks
on the other, hauing his aduersaries so néere at hand before him, he could not shift awaie
by any meanes, for if he should haue fled backe, they might easilie haue ouertaken him,
yer he could haue got out of their danger. And thus of force he was then constrained to
go with the earle, who brought him to Rutland, where they dined, and from thence they
rode vnto Flint to bed. The king had verie few about him of his freends, except onelie
the earle of Salisburie, the bishop of Carleill, the lord Stephan Scroope, sir Nicholas
Ferebie, a sonne also of the countesse of Salisburie, and Ienico Dartois a Gascoigne
that still ware the cognisance or deuise of his maister king Richard, that is to saie, a white
hart, and would not put it from him, neither for persuasions nor threats; by reason
whereof, when the duke of Hereford vnderstood it, he caused him to be committed to
prison within the castell of Chester. This man was the last (as saieth mine author) which
ware that deuise, and shewed well thereby his constant hart toward his maister, for the
which it was thought he should haue lost his life, but yet he was pardoned, and at length
reconciled to the dukes fauour, after he was king.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But now to our purpose. King Richard being thus come vnto the castell of Flint, on
the mondaie, the eightéenth of August, and the duke of Hereford being still aduertised
from houre to houre by posts, how the earle of North­um­ber­land sped, the morow following
being tuesdaie, and the ninetéenth of August, he came thither, &amp; mustered his
armie before the kings presence, which vndoubtedlie made a passing faire shew, being
verie well ordered by the lord Henrie Persie, that was appointed generall, or rather (as
we maie call him) master of the campe, vnder the duke, of the whole armie. There
were come alreadie to the castell, before the approching of the maine armie, the archbishop
of Canturburie, the duke of Aumarle, the earle of Worcester, and diuerse
other. The archbishop entred first, and then followed the other, comming into the first
ward.</p>

<p>The king that was walking aloft on the braies of the wals, to behold the comming of
the duke a farre off, might sée, that the archbishop and the other were come, and (as he
tooke it) to talke with him: wherevpon he foorthwith came downe vnto them, and beholding
that they did their due reuerence to him on their knées, he tooke them vp, and
drawing the archbishop aside from the residue, talked with him a good while, and as it
was reported, the archbishop willed him to be of good comfort, for he should be assured,
not to haue anie hurt, as touching his person; but he prophesied not as a prelat, but as a
Pilat. For, was it no hurt (thinke you) to his person, to be spoiled of his roialtie, to be
deposed from his crowne, to be translated from principalitie to prison, &amp; to fall from
honor into horror. All which befell him to his extreame hart greefe (no doubt:) which
to increase, meanes alas there were manie; but to diminish, helps (God wot) but a few.
So that he might haue said with the forlorne man in the mercilesse seas of his
miseries,</p>

<div><div class="pstanza">
<p class="pverse">Vt fera nimboso tumüerunt æquora vento,</p>
<p class="pverseb">In medijs lacera naue relinquor aquis.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="nowrap">¶ Some</span>
write (as before in a marginall note I haue quoted) that the archbishop of
Canturburie went with the earle of North­um­ber­land vnto Conwaie, and there talked with
him: and further, that euen then the king offered, in con­si­der­a­tion of his insufficiencie to
gouerne, freelie to resigne the crowne, and his kinglie title to the
same, vnto the duke of <span class="xxpn" id="p858">|858|</span>
Hereford. But forsomuch as those that were continuallie attendant about the king,
during the whole time of his abode at Conwaie, and till his comming to Flint, doo
plainelie affirme, that the archbishop came not to him, till this tuesdaie before his remoouing
from Flint vnto Chester, it maie be thought (the circumstances well considered)
that he rather made that promise here at Flint, than at Conwaie, although by the tenour
of an instrument, conteining the declaration of the archbishop of Yorke, and other com­mis­sion­ers
sent from the estates assembled in the next parlement, vnto the said king, it is
recorded to be at Conwaie, as after ye maie read. But there maie be some default in the
copie, as taking the one place for the other.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>But wheresoeuer this offer was made, after that the archbishop had now here at Flint
communed with the king, he departed, and taking his horsse againe, rode backe to meet
the duke, who began at that present to approch the castell, and compassed it round about,
euen downe to the sea, with his people ranged in good and séemelie order, at the foot of
the mounteins: and then the earle of North­um­ber­land passing foorth of the castell to the
duke, talked with him a while in sight of the king, being againe got vp to the walles, to
take better view of the armie, being now aduanced within two bowe shootes of the castell,
to the small reioising (ye may be sure) of the sorowfull king. The earle of North­um­ber­land
returning to the castell, appointed the king to be set to dinner (for he was fasting
till then) and after he had dined, the duke came downe to the castell himselfe, and entred
the same all armed, his bassenet onelie excepted, and being within the first gate, he staied
there, till the king came foorth of the inner part of the castell vnto him.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The dukes behauiour to the king at their méeting.</p>

<p>The dukes demand.</p></div>

<p>The king accompanied with the bishop of Carleill, the earle of Salisburie, and sir
Stephan Scroope knight, who bare the sword before him, and a few other, came foorth
into the vtter ward, and sate downe in a place prepared for him. Forthwith as the duke
got sight of the king, he shewed a reuerend dutie as became him, in bowing his knée,
and comming forward, did so likewise the second and third time, till the king tooke him
by the hand, and lift him vp, saieng; “Déere cousine, ye are welcome.” The duke
humblie thanking him said; “My souereigne lord and king, the cause of my comming at
this present, is (your honor saued) to haue againe restitution of my person, my lands
and heritage, through your fauourable licence.” The king hervnto answered; “Déere
cousine, I am readie to accomplish your will, so that you may inioy all that is yours,
without exception.”<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The king and the duke iournie togither towards London.</p>

<p>K. Richard sumptuous in apparell.</p></div>

<p>Méeting thus togither, they came foorth of the castell, and the king there called for
wine and after they had dronke, they mounted on horssebacke, and rode that night to
Flint, and the next daie vnto Chester, the third vnto Nantwich, the fourth to Newcastell.
Here, with glad countenance, the lord Thomas Beauchampe earle of Warwike met them,
that had beene confined into the Ile of Man, as before ye haue heard; but now was reuoked
home by the duke of Lancaster. From Newcastell they rode to Stafford, and the
sixt daie vnto Lichfield, and there rested sundaie all daie. After this, they rode foorth
and lodged at these places insuing, Couentrie, Dantrée, Northhampton, Dunstable, S.
Albons, &amp; so came to London: neither was the king permitted all this while to change
his apparell, but rode still through all these townes simplie clothed in one sute of raiment,
and yet he was in his time excéeding sumptuous in apparell, in so much as he had one
cote, which he caused to be made for him of gold and stone, valued at 30000 marks: &amp;
so he was brought the next waie to Westminster.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The dukes receiuing into London.</p></div>

<p>As for the duke, he was receiued with all the ioy and pompe that might be of the Londoners,
and was lodged in the bishops palace, by Paules church. It was a woonder to
sée what great concursse of people, &amp; what number of horsses came to him on the waie
as he thus passed the countries, till his comming to London, where (vpon his approch to
the citie) the maior rode foorth to receiue him, and a great number of other citizens.
Also the cleargie met him with procession, and such ioy appeared in the countenances of
the people, vttering the same also with words, as the like not lightlie
béene séene. For in <span class="xxpn" id="p859">|859|</span>
euerie towne and village where he passed, children reioised, women clapped their hands,
and men cried out for ioy. But to speake of the great numbers of people that flocked
togither in the fields and stréets of London at his comming, I here omit; neither will I
speake of the presents, welcommings, lauds, and gratifications made to him by the citizens
and communaltie.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The king cōmitted to the tower.</p></div>

<p>But now to the purpose. The next day after his comming to London, the king from
Westminster was had to the Tower, and there committed to safe custodie. Manie euil
disposed persons, assembling themselues togither in great numbers, intended to haue met
with him, and to haue taken him from such as had the conueieng of him, that they might
haue slaine him. But the maior and aldermen gathered to them the worshipful commoners
and graue citizens, by whose policie, and not without much adoo, the other were reuoked
from their euill purpose: albeit, before they might be pacified, they cōming to Westminster,
tooke maister Iohn Sclake deane of the kings chappell, and from thence brought
him to Newgate, and there laid him fast in irons.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>A parlement in the kings name.</p></div>

<p>After this was a parlement called by the duke of Lancaster, vsing the name of king
Richard in the writs directed foorth to the lords, and other states for their summons.
This parlement began the thirtéenth daie of September, in the which manie heinous points
of misgouernance and iniurious dealings in the ad­min­is­tra­tion of his kinglie office, were
laid to the charge of this noble prince king Richard, the which (to the end the commons
might be persuaded, that he was an vnprofitable prince to the com­mon-wealth, and
worthie to be deposed) were ingrossed vp in 33 solemne articles, heinous to the eares of
all men, and to some almost incredible, the verie effect of which articles here insue, according
to the copie which I haue séene, and is abridged by maister Hall as followeth.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>The articles obiected to king Richard, whereby he was counted worthie to be deposed
from his principalitie.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>1 FIRST, that king Richard wastfullie spent the treasure of the realme, and had giuen
the possessions of the crowne to men vnworthie, by reason whereof, new charges more and
more were laid on the poore cōmunaltie.&#160;&#160; And where diuerse lords, as well spirituall as
temporall, were appointed by the high court of parlement, to commune and treat of diuerse
matters concerning the com­mon-wealth of the realme, which being busie about the
same commission, he with other of his affinitie went about to impeach, and by force and
menacing compelled the iustices of the realme at Shrewesburie to condescend to his opinion,
for the destruction of the said lords, in so much that he began to raise warre against
Iohn duke of Lancaster, Richard earle of Arundell, Thomas earle of Warwike, and other
lords, contrarie to his honor and promise.</p>

<p>2 Item, that he caused his vncle the duke of Glocester to be arrested without law
and sent him to Calis, and there without iudgement murthered him, and although the
earle of Arundell vpon his arreignment pleaded his charter of pardon, he could not be
heard, but was in most vile and shamefull manner suddenlie put to death.</p>

<p>3 Item, he assembled certeine Lancashire and Cheshire men, to the intent to make
warre on the same lords, and suffered them to rob and pill, without correction or repréeue.</p>

<p>4 Item, although the king flateringlie, and with great dissimulation, made proclamation
through out the realme, that the lords before named were not attached of anie crime
of treason, but onlie for extortions and oppressions doone in this realme; yet he laid to
them in the parlement, rebellion and manifest treason.</p>

<p>5 Item, he hath compelled diuers of the said lords seruants and friends, by menaces
&amp; extreme pains, to make great fines to their vtter vndooing; and not­with­stand­ing his
pardon, yet he made them fine anew. <span class="xxpn" id="p860">|860|</span></p>

<p>6 Item, where diuerse were appointed to commune of the state of the realme, and the
commonwealth thereof, the same king caused all the rols and records to be kept from
them, contrarie to promise made in the parlement, to his open dishonor.</p>

<p>7 Item, he vncharitablie commanded, that no man vpon paine of losse of life, and
goods, should once intreat him for the returne of Henrie now duke of Lancaster.</p>

<p>8 Item, where this realme is holden of God, and not of the pope or other prince, the
said king Richard, after he had obteined diuerse acts of parlement, for his owne peculiar
profit and pleasure, then he obteined bulles and extreame censures from Rome, to compell
all men streightlie to kéepe the same, contrarie to the honour and ancient priuileges of
this realme.</p>

<p>9 Item, although the duke of Lancaster had doone his deuoire against Thomas duke
of Norfolke in proofe of his quarrell; yet the said king, without reason or ground, banished
him the realme for ten yeers, contrarie to all equitie.</p>

<p>10 Item, before the dukes departure, he vnder his broad seale licenced him to make
atturnies to prosecute and defend his causes: the said king after his departure, would
suffer none atturnie to appeare for him, but did with his at his pleasure.</p>

<p>11 Item, the same king put out diuerse shiriffes lawfullie elected, and put in their
roomes diuerse other of his owne, subuerting the law, contrarie to his oth and honor.</p>

<p>12 Item, he borowed great summes of monie, and bound him vnder his letters patents,
for the repaiment of the same, and yet not one penie paid.</p>

<p>13 Item, he taxed men at the will of him and his vnhappie councell, and the same
treasure spent in follie, not paieng poore men for their vittels and viands.</p>

<p>14 Item, he said, that the lawes of the realme were in his head, and sometimes in his
brest, by reason of which fantasticall opinion, he destroied noble men, and impouerished
the poore commons.</p>

<p>15 Item, the parlement setting and enacting diuerse notable statutes, for the profit
and aduancement of the com­mon-wealth, he by his priuie fréends and solicitors caused
to be enacted, that no act then enacted, should be more preiudiciall to him, than it was to
anie of his predecessors: through which prouiso he did often as he listed, and not as the
law did meane.</p>

<p>16 Item, for to serue his purpose, he would suffer the shiriffes of the shire to remaine
aboue one yeare or two.</p>

<p>17 Item, at the summons of the parlement, when knights and burgesses should be
elected, that the election had béene full procéeded, he put out diuerse persons elect, and
put other in their places, to serue his will and appetite.</p>

<p>18 Item, he had priuie espials in euerie shire, to heare who had of him anie com­mun­i­ca­tion;
and if he communed of his lasciuious liuing, or outragious dooings, he straightwaies
was apprehended, and put to a gréeuous fine.</p>

<p>19 Item, the spiritualtie alledged against him, that he at his going into Ireland, exacted
manie notable summes of monie, beside plate and iewels, without law or custome, contrarie
to his oth taken at his coronation.</p>

<p>20 Item, where diuerse lords and iustices were sworne to saie the truth of diuerse
things to them committed in charge, both for the honor of the relme, and profit of the
king, the said king so menaced them with sore threatenings, that no man would or durst
saie the right.</p>

<p>21 Item, that without the assent of the nobilitie, he carried the iewels, plate, and
treasure, ouer into Ireland, to the great impouerishment of the realme: and all the good
records for the common wealth, and against his extortions, he caused priuilie to be imbessled,
and conueied awaie.</p>

<p>22 Item, in all leagues and letters to be concluded or sent to the sée of Rome, or
other regions, his writing was so subtill and darke, that none other prince once beléeued
him, nor yet his owne subiects. <span class="xxpn" id="p861">|861|</span></p>

<p>23 Item, he most tyrannouslie and vnprincelie said, that the liues and goods of all his
subiects were in his hands, and at his disposition.</p>

<p>24 Item, that contrarie to the great charter of England, he caused diuerse lustie men
to appeale diuerse old men, vpon matters determinable at the common law in the court
Martiall, bicause that there is no triall, but onelie by battell: wherevpon, the said aged
persons, fearing the sequele of the matter, submitted themselues to his mercie, whome he
fined and ransomed vnreasonablie at his will and pleasure.</p>

<p>25 Item, he craftilie deuised certeine priuie othes, contrarie to the law, and caused
diuerse of his subiects first to be sworne to obserue the same, and after bound them in
bonds for kéeping of the same, to the great vndooing of manie honest men.</p>

<p>26 Item, where the chancellor, according to the law, would in no wise grant a prohibition
to a certeine person, the king granted it vnto the same, vnder his priuie seale, with
great threatenings, if it should be disobeied.</p>

<p>27 Item, he banished the bishop of Canturburie without cause or iudgement, and kept
him in the parlement chamber with men of armes.</p>

<p>28 Item, the bishops goods he granted to his successor, vpon condition, that he should
mainteine all his statutes made at Shrewesburie anno 21, and the statutes made anno 22
at Couentrie.</p>

<p>29 Item, vpon the accusation of the said bishop, the king craftilie persuaded him to
make no answer for he would be his warrant, and advised him not to come to the parlement,
and so without answer he was condemned and exiled, and his goods seized.</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>These be all the articles of anie effect, which were laid against
him, sauing foure other, which touched onelie the archbishops matter,
whose working wroong king Richard at length from his crowne. Then for
so much as these articles, and other heinous and detestable accusations
were laid against him in open parlement, it was thought by the most
part, that he was worthie to be deposed from all kinglie honor and
princelie gouernement: and to bring the matter without slander the
better to passe, diuerse of the kings seruants, which by licence
had accesse to his person, comforted him (being with sorrow almost
consumed, and in manner halfe dead) in the best wise they could,
exhorting him to regard his health, and saue his life.</p>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The king is persuaded to resigne the crowne to the duke.</p>

<p><i>Fabian.</i></p></div>

<p>And first, they aduised him willinglie to suffer himselfe to be
deposed, and to resigne his right of his owne accord, so that the duke
of Lancaster might without murther or battell obteine the scepter
and diademe, after which (they well perceiued) he gaped: by meane
whereof they thought he might be in perfect assurance of his life
long to continue. Whether this their persuasion procéeded by the
suborning of the duke of Lancaster and his fauourers, or of a sincere
affection which they bare to the king, as supposing it most sure in
an extremitie, it is vncerteine; but yet the effect followed not,
howsoeuer their meaning was: not­with­stand­ing, the king being now in
the hands of his enimies, and vtterlie despairing of all comfort, was
easilie persuaded to renounce his crowne and princelie preheminence,
so that in hope of life onelie, he agreed to all things that were of
him demanded. And so (as it should seeme by the copie of an instrument
hereafter following) he renounced and voluntarilie was deposed from
his roiall crowne and kinglie dignitie, the mondaie being the nine and
twentith daie of September, and feast of S. Michaell the archangell in
the yeare of our Lord 1399, and in the thrée and twentith yeare of his

the same he was at that houre in full purpose to performe and fulfill;
sauing that he desired first to haue personall speach with the said

<p>K. Richards resignation confirmed by parlement.</p></div>

<p>Vpon the morrow after being tuesdaie, and the last daie of September, all the lords
spirituall and temporall, with the commons of the said parlement, assembled at Westminster,
where, in the presence of them, the archbishop of Yorke, and the bishop of
Hereford, according to the kings request, shewed vnto them the voluntarie renouncing
of the king, with the fauour also which he bare to his cousine of Lancaster to haue him
his successour. And moreouer shewed them the schedule or bill of renouncement, signed
with king Richards owne hand, which they caused to be read first in Latine, as it
was written, and after in English. This doone, the question was first asked of the lords,
if they would admit and allow that renouncement: the which when it was of them
granted and confirmed, the like question was asked of the
commons, and of them in <span class="xxpn" id="p864">|864|</span>
like manner confirmed. After this, it was then declared, that not­with­stand­ing the foresaid
renouncing, so by the lords and commons admitted and confirmed, it were necessarie in
auoiding of all suspicions and surmises of euill disposed persons, to haue in writing and
registred the manifold crimes and defaults before doone by king Richard, to the end that
they might first be openlie declared to the people, and after to remaine of record amongst
other of the kings records for euer.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>All this was doone accordinglie, for the articles which before yee haue heard, were
drawne and ingrossed vp, and there shewed readie to be read; but for other causes more
néedfull as then to be preferred, the reading of those articles at that season was deferred.
Then forsomuch as the lords of the parlement had well considered the voluntarie resignation
(of king Richard, and that it was behoouefull and as they thought) necessarie for the
weale of the realme, to proceed vnto the sentence of his deposing, there were appointed by
the authoritie of all the estates there in parlement assembled, the bishop of saint Asaph,
the abbat of Glastenburie, the earle of Glocester, the lord Berkleie, William Thirning
iustice, and Thomas Erpingham, with Thomas Graie, knights, that they should giue and
pronounce the open sentence of the deposing of king Richard. Whervpon the said com­mis­sion­ers
taking counsell togither, by good and deliberate aduise therein had, with one
assent agréed, that the bishop of S. Asaph should publish the sentence for them and in
their names, as followeth.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>The publication of king Richards deposing.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">IN
the name of God Amen.&#160;&#160; We Iohn bishop of S. Asaph, Iohn abbat of Glastenburie,
Thomas earle of Glocester, Thomas lord Berkeleie, William Thirning iustice,
Thomas Erpingham &amp; Thomas Graie knights, chosen and deputed speciall commissaries
by the three states of this present parlement, representing the whole bodie of the realme,
for all such matters by the said estates to vs committed: we vnderstanding and considering
the manifold crimes, hurts, and harmes doone by Richard king of England, and misgouernance
of the same by a long time, to the great decaie of the said land, and vtter ruine
of the same shortlie to haue beene, had not the speciall grace of our God therevnto put
the sooner remedie: and also furthermore aduerting, that the said king Richard by
acknowledging his owne insufficiencie, hath of his owne meere voluntee and free will, renounced
and giuen ouer the rule &amp; gouernance of this land, with all rights and honours
vnto the same belonging, and vtterlie for his merits hath iudged himselfe not vnwoorthilie
to be deposed of all kinglie maiestie and estate roiall.&#160;&#160; We the premisses well considering
by good and diligent deliberation, by the power, name, and authoritie to vs (as aboue is
said) committed, pronounce, decerne, and declare the same king Richard, before this to
haue beene, and to be vnprofitable, vnable, vnsufficient, and vnwoorthie of the rule and
gouernance of the foresaid realms and lordships, and of all rights and other the appurtenances
to the same belonging.&#160;&#160; And for the same causes we depriue him of all kinglie
dignitie and worship, and of any kinglie worship in himselfe.&#160;&#160; And we depose him by our
sentence definitiue, forbidding expresselie to all archbishops, and bishops, and all other
prelats, dukes, marquesses, erles, barons and knights, and all other men of the foresaid
kingdome and lordships, subiects, and lieges whatsoeuer they be, that none of them from
this daie forward, to the foresaid Richard as king and lord of the foresaid realmes and
lordships, be neither obedient nor attendant.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>After which sentence thus openlie declared, the said estates admitted foorthwith the
forenamed com­mis­sion­ers for their procurators, to resigne and yeeld vp vnto king Richard,
all their homage and fealtie, which in times past they had made and owght vnto him, and
also for to declare vnto him (if need were) all things before doone
that concerned the <span class="xxpn" id="p865">|865|</span>
purpose and cause of his deposing: the which resignation was respited till the morow following.
Immediatlie as the sentence was in this wise passed, and that by reason thereof the
realme stood void without head or gouernour for the time, the duke of Lancaster rising
from the place where before he sate, and standing where all those in the house might
behold him, in reuerend manner made a signe of the crosse on his forhead, and likewise on
his brest, and after silence by an officer commanded, said vnto the people there being present,
these words following.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>The duke of Lancaster laieth challenge or claime to the crowne.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p class="pfirst">IN

am descended by right line of the blood comming from that good lord king Henrie the
third, and through the right that God of his grace hath sent me, with the helpe of my kin,
and of my freends, to recouer the same, which was in point to be vndoone for default of
good gouernance and due iustice.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="sidenotea">
<p>The demand of the archbishop of Canturburie to the commons.</p>

<p><i>Thom. Wals.</i></p>

<p>The duke of Hereford placed in the regall throne.</p>

<p>The archbishop preached.</p></div>

<p>After these words thus by him vttered, he returned and sate him downe in the place
where before he had sitten. Then the lords hauing heard and well perceiued this claime
thus made by this noble man, ech of them asked of other what they thought therein. At
length, after a little pausing or staie made, the archbishop of Canturburie hauing notice of
the minds of the lords, stood vp &amp; asked the commons if they would assent to the lords,
which in their minds thought the claime of the duke made, to be rightfull and necessarie
for the wealth of the realme and them all: whereto the commons with one voice cried,
Yea, yea, yea. After which answer, the said archbishop going to the duke, and knéeling
downe before him on his knee, addressed to him all his purpose in few words. The which
when he had ended, he rose, &amp; taking the duke by the right hand, led him vnto the kings
seate, the archbishop of Yorke assisting him, and with great reuerence set him therein,
after that the duke had first vpon his knées made his praier in deuout manner vnto
almightie God. When he was thus placed in his throne to the great reioising of the people,
the archbishop of Canturburie began a breefe collation, taking for his theme these
words, written in the first booke of kings the ninth chapter; Vir dominabitur in populo,
&#038;c: handling the same, &amp; the whole tenour of his tale to the praise of the king, whose
setled iudgement, grounded wisedome, perfect reason, and ripe discretion was such (said
he) as declared him to be no child, neither in yeares, nor in light conditions, but a man
able and méete for the gouernement of a realme: so that there was no small cause of comfort
ministred to them through the fauourable goodnesse of almightie God, which had
prouided them of such a gouernor, as like a discréet iudge shall déeme in causes by
skilfull doomes, and rule his subiects in vpright equitie, setting apart all wilfull pleasures,
and childish inconstancie. This is a summarie of his oration. But because the qualitie
of this volume is such, as that it hath set foorth matters at large: I will laie downe
the archbishops words, as they are recorded by Fabian in ample manner as followeth.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>The archbishop of Canturburie his oration, framed vpon this text, Vir
dominabitur in populo, &#038;c: written in the first booke of kings and
ninth chapter.</h3>

<blockquote>
<div class="sidenotea">
<p><i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of <i>Fabian</i>, pag. 351.</p></div>
<p class="pfirst">THESE
be the words of the high, and most mightie king, speaking to Samuel his prophet,
teaching him how he should choose and ordaine a gouernor of his people of Israell,
when the said people asked of him a king, to rule them.&#160;&#160; And not without cause may
these woords be said here of our lord the king that is.&#160;&#160; For, if they be
inwardlie conceiued, <span class="xxpn" id="p866">|866|</span>
they shall giue vnto vs matter of consolation and comfort, when it is said that a man shall
haue lordship and rule of the people, and not a child.&#160;&#160; For God threatneth not vs as he
sometime threatned the people by Esaie, saieng: Esa. 3. Et dabo pueros principes eorum,
&amp; effeminati dominabuntur eis, I shall (saith our Lord) giue children to be their rulers
&amp; princes, and weake or fearefull shall haue dominion ouer them.&#160;&#160; But of his great
mercie he hath visited vs, I trust his peculiar people, and sent vs a man to haue the rule
of vs, &amp; put by children that before time ruled this land, after childish conditions, as by
the woorkes of them it hath rightlie appeared, to the disturbance of all this realme; and
for want and lacke of a man.&#160;&#160; For, as saith the apostle Paule ad Corinthos, 1. capite 14.
Cùm essem paruulus, loquebar vt paruulus, &#038;c: quando autem factus sum vir, euacuaui
quæ erant paruuli, that is to say, When I was a child, I sauored and spake as a child,
but at the time when I came vnto the estate of a man, then I put by
all my childish conditions.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The apostle saith, he sauored and spake as a child, in whome is no stedfastnesse, or
constancie.&#160;&#160; For a child will lightlie promise, and lightlie he will breake his promise, and
doo all things that his appetite giueth him vnto, and forgetteth lightlie what he hath doone.&#160;&#160;
By which reason it followeth, that needilie great inconuenience must fall to that people,
that a child is ruler and gouernour of: nor it is not possible for that kingdome to stand
in felicitie, where such conditions reigne in the head and ruler of the same.&#160;&#160; But now we
ought all to reioise, that all such defaults be expelled, and that a man, and not a child, shall
haue lordship ouer vs.&#160;&#160; To whom it belongeth to haue a sure rane vpon his toong, that
he maie be knowne from a child, or a man vsing childish conditions: of whom I trust I
maie say, as the wise man saith in his prouerbs, Prouerb. 3. cap. Beatus homo qui inuenit
sapientiam, &amp; qui affluit prudentia, that is to say; Blessed be the man that hath sapience
or wisdome, and that aboundeth in prudence.&#160;&#160; For that man that is ruled by sapience, must
needs loue &amp; dred our Lord God, and who so loueth &amp; dreadeth him, it must consequentlie
follow that he must keepe his commandements.&#160;&#160; By force whereof he shall
minister true iustice vnto his subiects, and doo no wrong nor iniurie to any man.</p>

<p>So that then shall follow the words of the wise man the which be rehearsed, Prouerb.
10. Benedictio Domini super caput iusti, os autem impiorum operit iniquitatem, that is
to saie, The blessing of our Lord God shall light vpon the head of our king, being a iust
and righteous man, for the toong of him worketh equitie and iustice; but the toong of the
wicked &amp; of sinners couereth iniquitie.&#160;&#160; And who so worketh or ministreth iustice in
due order, he not onlie safegardeth himself, but also holdeth people in a suertie of restfulnes,
of the which insueth peace and plentie.&#160;&#160; And therefore it is said of the wise king
Salomon, Eccles. 10. Beata terra cuius rex nobilis est, vel cuius principes vescuntur in
tempore suo, wich is to be vnderstanded, that blessed &amp; happie is that land, of the which
the king or ruler is noble and wise, and the princes be blessed that liue in his time.&#160;&#160; As
who would say, they may take example of him to rule and guide their subiects.&#160;&#160; For by
the discretion of a noble and wise man being in authoritie, manie euils be sequestred and
set apart, all dissemblers put to silence.&#160;&#160; For the wise man considereth and noteth well
the great in­con­uen­i­en­ces which dailie now growe of it, where the child or insipient
drinketh the sweet and delicious words vnaduisedlie, and perceiueth not intoxication which
they be mingled or mixt with, till he be inuironed and wrapped in all danger, as latelie the
experience thereof hath beene apparent to all our sights and knowledges, &amp; not without
the great danger of all this realme.&#160;&#160; And all was for lacke of wisedome in the
ruler, which deemed &amp; taught as a child, giuing sentence of wilfulnesse and not
of reason.&#160;&#160; So that while a child reigned, selfe-will &amp; lust reigned, and reason
with good conscience were outlawed, with iustice, stedfastnesse, and manie other
vertues.</p>

<p>But of this perill and danger we be deliuered by the especiall helpe and grace of God,
Quia vir dominabitur in populo, that is to saie, He that is not a child but perfect
in reason.&#160;&#160; <span class="xxpn" id="p867">|867|</span>
For he commeth not to execute his owne will, but his will that sent him, that is to wit, Gods
will, as a man vnto whome God of his abundant grace hath giuen perfect reason and discretion,
to discerne &amp; deeme as a perfect man.&#160;&#160; Wherfore not all onlie of this man we
shall saie that he shall dwell in wisedome, but as a perfect man and not a child, he shall
thinke, and deeme, &amp; haue such a circumspection with him, that he shall diligentlie forelooke
and see that Gods will be doone, &amp; not his.&#160;&#160; And therfore now I trust the words of
the wise man, Ecclesiast. 10. shall be verified in our king: saieng, Iudex sapiens iudicabit
populum suum &amp; principatus sensati stabilis erit; that is (as saith the wiseman) A wise
and discreet iudge shall now deeme his people, and the dominion or lordship of a discreet
wiseman shall stand stedfast.&#160;&#160; Wherevpon shall then follow the second verse of the same
chapter, saieng, Secundum iudicem populi, sic &amp; ministri eius, that is, Like as the
head &amp; sovereigne is replenished with all sapience and vertue, in guiding of his people,
administring to them law, with due and conuenient iustice, so shall the subiects againward
be garnished with awe and louing dread, and beare vnto him next God all honour, truth
and allegiance.</p>

<p>So that then it may be concluded with the residue of the foresaid verses; Qualis rector
est ciuitatis, tales &amp; inhabitantes in ea, which is to saie, Such as the ruler of the citie is,
such then be the inhabitants of the same.&#160;&#160; So that consequentlie it followeth, a good
master maketh a good disciple.&#160;&#160; And likewise an euill king or ruler shall lose his people,
&amp; the cities of his kingdome shall be left desolate and vnhabited.&#160;&#160; Wherefore thus I
make an end.&#160;&#160; In sted of a child wilfullie doing his lust and pleasure without reason,
now shall a man be lord and ruler, that is replenished with sapience and reason, and shall
gouerne the people by skilfull doome, setting apart all wilfulnesse and pleasure of himselfe.&#160;&#160;
So that the word that I began with may be verified of him, Ecce quia vir dominabitur
in populo.&#160;&#160; The which our lord grant, &amp; that he may prosperouslie reigne vnto the
pleasure of God and wealth of his realme,
Amen.</p></blockquote></div><!--chapter-->

<p>The words of the elected king.</p></div>

<p>After the archbishop had ended, wishing that it might so come to passe, and the people
answered, Amen; the king standing on his féet, said unto the lords and commons there
present: “I thanke you my lords both spirituall and temporall, and all the states of this
land, and doo you to wit, that it is not my will that any man thinke, that I by the waie
of conquest would disherit any man of his heritage, franches, or other rights, that him
ought to haue of right, nor to put him out of that which he now inioieth, and hath had
before time by custome or good law of this realme, except such priuat persons as haue
béene against the good purpose, and the common profit of the realme.” When he had
thus ended, all the shiriffes and other officers were put in their authorities againe, to exercise
the same as before, which they could not doo whilest the kings roiall throne was void.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>The coronation proclaimed.</p>

<p>Moreouer, a proclamation was made, that the states should assemble againe in parlement
on mondaie then next insuing, being the feast daie of saith Faith, which is the
sixt of October; and that the monday then next following, being the 13 of the same
moneth, and the feast day of saint Edward the king and confessor, the coronation should
be solemnized, and that all such as had to claime any seruice to be doone by them at the
same by any tenure, they should come to the White-hall in the kings palace, before the
steward and constable of England, on saturdaie next before the same day of the parlement,
and presenting their petitions that were due &amp; rightfull, they should obteine that
to them apperteined. Excuse was also made on the kings behalfe, for calling of a parlement
vpon so short a warning, so as the knights and burgesses were not changed, but
onelie appointed to assemble againe, as if the other parlement had rather beene continued
than dissolued. The cause was alledged to be for easing of the charges that would
haue risen, if ech man had béene sent home, and new knights and burgesses called.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>These things doone, the king rose from his place, and with a chéerefull and right courteous
countenance regarding the people, went to White-hall, where
the same day he held <span class="xxpn" id="p868">|868|</span>
a great feast. In the after noone were proclamations made in the accustomed places of
the citie, in the name of king Henrie the fourth. On the morrow following, being wednesdaie
the first of October, the procurators aboue named repaired to the tower of London,
and thare signified vnto king Richard the admission of king Henrie. And the aforesaid
iustice William Thirning, in name of the other, and for all the states of the land, renounced
vnto the said Richard late king, all homage and fealtie vnto him before time due,
in maner and forme as apperteined. Which renuntiation to the deposed king, was a redoubling
of his greefe, in so much as thereby it came to his mind, how in former times
he was acknowledged &amp; taken for their liege lord and souereigne, who now (whether
in contempt or in malice, God knoweth) to his face forsware him to be their king. So

<p>Thus was king Richard depriued of all kinglie honour and princelie dignitie, by reason
he was so giuen to follow euill counsell, and vsed such inconuenient waies and meanes,
through insolent misgouernance, and youthfull outrage, though otherwise a right noble
and woorthie prince. He reigned two and twentie yeares, three moneths and eight daies.
He deliuered to king Henrie now that he was thus deposed, all the goods that he had, to
the summe of three hundred thousand pounds in coine, besides plate and iewels, as a
pledge and satisfaction of the iniuries by him committed and doone, in hope to be in
more suertie of life for the deliuerie thereof: but whatsoeuer was promised, he was deceiued
therein. For shortlie after his resignation, he was conueied to the castell of Leeds
in Kent, &amp; frō thence to Pomfret, where he departed out of this miserable life (as after
you shall heare.) He was séemelie of shape and fauor, &amp; of nature good inough, if the
wickednesse &amp; naughtie demeanor of such as were about him had not altered it.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

<p>His chance verelie was greatlie infortunate, which fell into such calamitie, that he
tooke it for the best waie he could deuise to renounce his kingdome, for the which mortall
men are accustomed to hazard all they haue to atteine therevnto. But such misfortune
(or the like) oftentimes falleth vnto those princes, which when they are aloft, cast
no doubt for perils that maie follow. He was prodigall, ambitious, and much giuen to
the pleasure of the bodie. He kept the greatest port, and mainteined the most plentifull
house that euer any king in England did either before his time or since. For there resorted
dailie to his court aboue ten thousand persons that had meat and drinke there
allowed them. In his kitchen there were thrée hundred seruitors, and euerie other office
was furnished after the like rate. Of ladies, chamberers, and landerers, there were aboue
thrée hundred at the least. And in gorgious and costlie apparell they exceeded all measure,
not one of them that kept within the bounds of his degrée. Yeomen and groomes
were clothed in silkes, with cloth of graine and skarlet, ouer sumptuous ye may be sure
for their estates. And this vanitie was not onelie vsed in the court in those daies, but
also other people abroad in the towns and countries, had their garments cut far otherwise
than had beene accustomed before his daies, with imbroderies, rich furres, and goldsmiths

<p>Moreouer, such were preferred to bishoprikes, and other ec­cles­i­ast­i­call liuings, as
neither could teach nor preach, nor knew any thing of the scripture of God, but onelie
to call for their tithes and duties; so that they were most vnworthie the name of bishops,
being lewd and most vaine persons disguised in bishops apparell. Furthermore, there
reigned abundantlie the filthie sinne of leacherie and fornication, with abhominable adulterie,
speciallie in the king, but most chéefelie in the prelacie, whereby
the whole realme by <span class="xxpn" id="p869">|869|</span>
such their euill example, was so infected, that the wrath of God was dailie prouoked to
vengeance for the sins of the prince and his people. How then could it continue prosperouslie
with this king? against whom for the fowle enormities wherewith his life was
defamed, the wrath of God was whetted and tooke so sharpe an edge, that the same did
shred him off from the scepter of his kingdome, and gaue him a full cup of affliction to
drinke; as he had doone to other kings his predecessors, by whose example he might
haue taken warning. For it is an heauie case when God thundereth out his reall arguments
either vpon prince or people.<br class="fltstop" /></p>

of this king. But if I may boldlie saie what I thinke: he was a prince the most vnthankfullie
vsed of his subiects, of any one of whom ye shall lightlie read. For although
(thorough the frailtie of youth) he demeaned himed himselfe more dissolutelie than séemed
conuenient for his roiall estate, &amp; made choise of such councellors as were not fauoured
of the people, whereby he was the lesse fauoured himselfe: yet in no kings daies were
the commons in greater wealth, if they could haue perceiued their happie state: neither
in any other time were the nobles and gentlemen more cherished, nor churchmen lesse
wronged. But such was their ingratitude towards their bountifull and louing souereigne,
that those whom he had chéeflie aduanced, were readiest to controll him; for that they
might not rule all things at their will, and remooue from him such as they misliked, and
place in their roomes whom they thought good, and that rather by strong hand, than by
gentle and courteous meanes, which stirred such malice betwixt him and them, till at
length it could not be asswaged without perill of destruction to them both.</p>

<p>The duke of Glocester chéefe instrument of this mischéefe, to what end he came ye haue
heard. And although his nephue the duke of Hereford tooke vpon him to reuenge his
death, yet wanted he moderation and loialtie in his dooings, for the which both he himselfe
and his lineall race were scourged afterwards, as a due punishment vnto rebellious
subiects; so as deserued vengeance seemed not to staie long for his ambitious crueltie,
that thought it not inough to driue king Richard to resigne his crowne and regall dignitie
ouer vnto him, except he also should take from him his guiltlesse life. What vnnaturalnesse,
or rather what tigerlike crueltie was this, not to be content with his principalitie?
not to be content with his treasure? not to be content with his depriuation? not to be
content with his imprisonment? but being so neerelie knit in consanguinitie, which ought
to haue moued them like lambs to haue loued each other, wooluishlie to lie in wait for
the distressed creatures life, and rauenouslie to thirst after his bloud, the spilling whereof
should haue touched his conscience so, as that death ought rather to
haue beene aduentured
for his safetie, than so sauagelie to haue sought his life after the losse of his
roialtie.</p>

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p>Original spelling and grammar are generally retained, with a few
exceptions noted below. Original page numbers look like this: |735|.
I constructed the cover image, and hereby release it to the wild.</p>

<p>This transcription is based on page images scanned from an edition
with publication date 1807. The title page information, together
with Part 1 of this Volume II, is located in Project Gutenburg
ebook#16738. The page images used herein probably were private, not
available on the internet; but Google has made page images from the
same edition available―see [Title: Chronicles of England, Scotland
and Ireland, Volume 2 Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland,
Raphael Holinshed; Author: Raphael Holinshed; Publisher: Johnson,
1807; Original from: the Bavarian State Library; Digitized: Nov
25, 2009; ID=4r0_AAAAcAAJ] at books.google.com. This 1807 edition
seems to be closely based on the 1587 edition of the <i>Chronicles</i>,
printed in blackletter. Page images from the 1587 edition are
available from the University of Pennsylvania. Vol. II, part 12 is at
http://sceti.library.upenn.edu (textID=holinshed_richII). In a very few
instances listed below, corrections have been made, or questions have
been answered, by referring to the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Current ebook software does not lend itself optimally to the
original close association of sidenotes with specific lines of text.
Therefore sidenotes are now assigned to specific paragraphs rather
than to lines. Moreover, the original sidenotes were often printed
in a manner which makes it impossible to distinguish one sidenote
paragraph from the next. One example of this occurred on page
<a href="#p850">850</a>, with
a sidenote printed like this:</p>

<div><div class="nowrap fsize6">
    <p><i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of</p>
    <p><i>Thom. Wals.</i></p>
    <p>pag. 395.</p>
    <p><i>Polydor.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">It turns out,
proven by comparison with the 1587 edition, that
<i>Polydor.</i> is a separate paragraph from the rest. But there are many
similar instances, both in this 1807 edition and in the 1587 edition,
none of which have been checked.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p735">735</a>. In “the denied to paie for hir” <i>the</i> was changed to <i>she</i>,
to agree with the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p739">739</a>. In “cruell proceedings of those rude &amp; baee people”, change <i>baee</i> to <i>base</i>,
to conform with the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p763">763</a>. The extra <i>the</i> was removed from “heard the the friers
information”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p767">767</a>. From “An other day 72 French ships (as they”, the unmatched left
parenthesis mark was removed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p772">772</a>–773. Two sidenotes appear similar; the first is partially
illegible, and is herein made the same as the second. The second is
less illegible, and appears to be “<i>Abr. Fl.</i> out of <i>Henrie Knighton</i>
canon of Leicester abbeie”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p776">776</a>. The sidenote attached to the last paragraph was partly
illegible, and is herein rendered “The king of Armenia sueth for”.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p788">788</a>. In “to hurt them, or or cause any hurt”, removed the extra <i>or</i>,
per the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p790">790</a>. In “to tarie louger, as one despairing”, changed <i>louger</i> to
<i>longer</i>, per the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p798">798</a>. In “the state of the meanest peason”, changed <i>peason</i> to
<i>person</i>, to comform with the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p801">801</a>. In “one of the heires to to Iohn Scot”, removed the extra
<i>to</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p803">803</a>. From “which (according (as I haue seene noted) was”, removed
the second left parenthesis, to agree with the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p804">804</a>. In “deliuered by the mouth of Walter Langhton”, retained, the
<i>n</i> should probably be <i>u</i>, making the word <i>Laughton</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p807">807</a>. In “saluo iure alterius cuiuscunq;.”, the text in the 1587
edition shows the “semicolon” as subscript, although it is retained
herein as shown unsubscripted in the 1807 edition. Together with the
<i>q</i>, this might be a ligature for <i>que</i>. There are several other
instances of words ending in "q;", none of which have subscripted
semicolons in this 1807 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p829">829</a>. From “more bold to interlace) about”, removed the unmatched
right parenthesis.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p834">834</a>. Original “prease on London bridg [*missing*] by reason
thereof”, changed to “prease on London bridge, that by reason thereof”,
per the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p842">842</a>. In “foure thousand nobles yéere e paid out of”, changed
<i>yéere e</i> to <i>yéerelie</i>, per the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p844">844</a>. In ‘than well.” “No more said the king,’, removed the
unmatched left quotation mark from <i>No</i>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p845">845</a>. The unmatched right double quotation mark was removed from the
phrase ‘it could not be so brought to passe, his
honor saued.’</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p847">847</a>. A matching right double quotation mark was added to the end of
the sentence beginning ‘The proclamation ended, an other herald cried’.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p857">857</a>. In “but the earle rode before, at it were”, changed <i>at</i> to
<i>as</i>, per the 1587 edition.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#p869">869</a>. In “God thundereth out his reall arguguments”, changed <i>arguguments</i>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
